1	2019	Synthesis and in vitro cytotoxicity evaluation of star-shaped polymethacrylic conjugates with methotrexate or acitretin as potential antipsoriatic prodrugs	Water-soluble polymer-drug conjugates were obtained and analyzed towards their potential use as prodrugs for two hydrophobic antipsoriatic agents, including methotrexate (MTX) and acitretin (AC). The conjugation efficacy of MTX decreased with a decreasing molar ratio of N,N-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate (DMAEMA) repeating units in the polymethacrylic chains. Cytotoxicity of positively charged (from +5 to +10 mV) nanoand microparticles (3–1500 nm in DMEM at 37 °C) were estimated by in vitro MTT and Annexin-V apoptosis assays on Me45, NHDF, HaCaT and BEAS-2B cell lines. Further, cell cycle analysis revealed arrest in G0/G1 phase in melanoma cells, while neither apoptosis induction nor cell cycle arrest occurred in normal epidermal and epithelial cells. Tested conjugates displayed a novel cytostatic effect in Me45 cells and a pro-apoptotic effect in HaCaT cells. Epithelial BEAS-2B cells were the most sensitive to the tested conjugates and responded via induction of necrosis. Cell line models allowed for characterization of the biologically relevant potential action of pro-drugs. Additionally, a skin in vitro evaluation assay provided the first known evidence of side-effect reduction with pro-drug use. Histological examinations confirmed the lack of negative effects of conjugates on the skin and showed no irritating properties. 1. Introduction Since the mid-1950s, many toxic agents have been commonly used in the treatment of various diseases from cancer to metabolic disorders. Methotrexate (MTX) and its derivatives were used to alleviate abnormalities in keratinocytes (Saporito and Menter, 2004). Administration of MTX in patients with psoriatic arthritis has been shown to develop numerous side effects and is connected with risk of kidney, liver, bone marrow and digestive tract damage. As an antiproliferative cytostatic agent, MTX is dangerous for pregnant women and may lead to the development of teratomas (Saporito and Menter, 2004). Psoriasis is a well-studied disorder characterized by an immunological interaction of blood circulating T-cells with keratinocytes inducing an auto-immune response. Methotrexate activates the apoptosis pathway in peripheral T-cells as a response to its high innate cytotoxicity (Izeradjene et al., 2001). As a monotherapy, methotrexate acts as an anti-inflammatory agent; however, novel derivatives combined with immunosuppressive agents are more desirable for combination tactics (Saporito and Menter, 2004). Combination of methotrexate and cyclosporine was approved in rheumatology; however, this combination is in need of more advance studies for use with dermal disorders due to increased side-effects (Korstanje et al., 1990). Combination of methotrexate with a monoclonal antibody against pro-inflammatory TNFα (infliximab), significantly reduced organ toxicity, promoted liver and renal recovery, and visibly reduced signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis (Kirby et al., 2001). Numerous drug delivery systems (DDS) were developed for improving methotrexate bioavailability and decreasing the occurrence and severity of the side effects. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), for example, have been used to prepare methotrexate conjugates, creating a delivery system which reduced toxicity within 48 h shown via an in vitro MTT assay of C57BL/6 mouse normal skin (Bessar et al., 2016). Combination of methotrexate with natural and synthetic macromolecular carriers has been used for synthesis of copolymers, improving compound solubility in neutral or low pH, representative of the cellular environment, and increasing bioactivity, e.g. polymethacrylate–MTX conjugates in keratinocytes (HaCaT) (Bernaczek et al., 2019). Linkers, a part of the DDS, in methotrexate polymer-drug conjugate, are mostly cleavable and thus more effective in the site of action. Acitretin is a second generation retinoid which suppresses the proliferation of epidermal keratinocytes, reduces the infiltration of inflammatory cells, downregulates the expression of interferon as well as interleukin (IL)-17 (An et al., 2017). Therefore, acitretin is widely used for the treatment of severe psoriasis and other dermatoses. Acitretin is usually administrated without a carrier or in a chitin-based nanogel, where the drug is conjugated to the carrier by strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds (Divya et al., 2016). In recent years, biodegradable compounds, defined by glycerol and adipic acid esters, were used in the design of co-polymers for anticancer therapy and dermal applications (Suksiriworapong et al., 2018). However, synthetic copolymers, with the ability to self-assemble into particles with specific dimensions physicochemical and biological properties, are now being intensively studied for utilization as drug nanocarriers across indications (Neugebauer et al., 2019). To reduce the negative clinical side effects of methotrexate and acitretin (AC) and to improve the properties of these drugs, a series of polymer-MTX and polymer-AC prodrugs were obtained. Response to nanosized polymeric prodrugs was evaluated across multiple cell lines including, cancer melanoma (Me45), normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF), keratinocytes (HaCaT) and bronchial epithelial (BEAS-2B) cells, using MTT, cell cycle, and Annexin-V apoptosis assays. Further, we studied multiple concentrations of prodrugs on cell cycle and cell death induction. The most effective doses were evaluated via in vitro cocultivation skin assays for 48 h. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Materials Methotrexate (MTX, AK Scientific, 99%), dimethylformamide (DMF, extra dry, Acros Organics), acitretin (AC, TCI, > 98%), 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP, Acros Organics, 99%), 2-chloro-1-methylpyridinium iodide (CMPI, Aldrich, 97%). Synthesis and characterization of polymers, which were used for conjugations of MTX and AC, were described previously (Mielańczyk et al., 2018). 2.2. Synthesis and characterization of polymer-MTX prodrug (S2-MTX) Star-shaped P(DMAEMA-co-HEMA) (100 mg, 22.2 mmol of hydroxyl groups) was dissolved in 16 ml of DMF. Subsequently, MTX (101 mg, 22.2 mmol), DMAP (27.2 mg, 22.2 mmol) and CMPI (56.9 mg, 22.2 mmol) were added. The reaction mixture was purged with Ar and stirred in the dark for 24 h. Next, the reaction mixture was diluted with 16 ml of deionized water and transferred into the cellulose membrane (MWCO 3500 Da) and dialyzed against deionized water. The progress of purification was monitored by UV–Vis. Finally, the product was lyophilized. The yellowish powder (Yield 45%) was characterized by basic spectroscopy and chromatography methods. 1 H NMR (600 MHz, DMSO-d6, δ): 8.58 (s, 1H, H-8), 8.21 (d, J = 6 Hz 1H, NH), 7.74 (d, J = 9 Hz, 3H, H-10, andNH2), 7.61–7.51 (m, 1H, NH2), 6.83 (d, J = 9 Hz, 2H, H-13), 6.79–6.65 (m, 2H, NH2), 4.79 (s, 1H, H-14) 4.40 (m, 1H, H-15), 4.21–3.96 (m, 2H, c1), 3.96–3.81 (m, 6H, d2, c2), 3.71–3.50 (m, 2H, CH2OH), 3.22 (s, 3H, H-16), 2.79–2.60 (m, 2H, d1), 2.18–2.15 (m, 8H, e, H-18), 2.15–1.57 (m, 8H, b2, H-17), 1.20–0.58 (m, 9H, a1, a2). SEC (DMF, 10 mMLiBr): Mn, SEC = 78500 g/mol, Đ = 1.24. 2.3. Synthesis and characterization of polymer-AC prodrug (S2-AC) Star-shaped P(DMAEMA-co-HEMA) (50 mg, 11.1 mmol of hydroxyl groups) was dissolved in 32 ml of DMF. Subsequently, AC (36.3 mg, 11.1 mmol), DMAP (13.6 mg, 11.1 mmol) and CMPI (28.5 mg, 11.1 mmol) were added. The reaction mixture was purged with Ar and stirred in the dark for 24 h. Next, the reaction mixture was diluted with 16 ml of deionized water and transferred into the cellulose membrane (MWCO 3500 Da) and dialyzed against deionized water. The progress of purification was monitored by UV–Vis. Finally, the product was lyophilized. The yellowish powder (Yield 74%) was characterized by basic spectroscopy and chromatography methods. 1 H NMR (600 MHz, DMSO-d6, δ): 7.06 (dd, 1H, J = 9 Hz, H-7), 6.72 (d, J = 15 Hz, 1H, H11), 6.43 (d, J = 15 Hz, 1H, H-12), 6.31 (s, 1H, H-4), 6.27 (d, J = 6 Hz, 1H, H-8), 5.79 (s, 1H, H-10), 4.21–3.96 (m, 6H, c1 and -OCH3), 3.96–3.81 (m, 6H, d2, c2), 3.71–3.50 (m, 2H, CH2OH), 2.79–2.60 (m, 2H, d1), 2.18–2.15 (m, 6H, e), 2.15–1.57 (m, 19H, b2, 5x –CH3), 1.20–0.58 (m, 9H, a1, a2). SEC (DMF, 10 mMLiBr): Mn, SEC = 88000 g/ mol, Đ = 1.23. 2.4. UV–vis spectroscopy measurements UV–vis spectroscopy (Thermo Scientific Evolution 300) was used to determine the amount of conjugated drug by measuring the maximum of absorbance peak (λ = 378 nm for MTX and λ = 352 nm in case of AC) at the polymer-drug conjugate spectrum. Before analysis, the calibration curves were prepared for each of the drugs within the appropriate range of concentration. Next, 1 mg of the polymer-MTX conjugate was dissolved in 10 ml of DMF:H2O mixture (1:1 v/v), whereas in the case of polymer-AC conjugate the absorbance was measured in methanol. 2.5. Nuclear magnetic resonance 1 H NMR spectra of the polymers and polymer-drug conjugates solutions in DMSO-d6 were collected on Varian Inova 600 MHz spectrometer at 26 °C using TMS as an internal standard. 2.6. Size exclusion chromatography Molecular weights (Mn, SEC) and dispersity indices (Ð) were determined by size-exclusion chromatograph (SEC, Thermo Scientific, Ultimate 3000) equipped with an ISO-3100SD isocratic pump, autosampler, degasser, thermostatic box for columns, and differential refractometer RefractoMax 521 Detector. Chromoleon 7.2 Chromatography Data System (CDS, Thermo Scientific) was used for data collecting and processing. The SEC calculated molecular weights were based on calibration applying linear polystyrene standards (Mp = 1280–3 053 000 g/mol). Pre-column guard 5 μm (50 × 7.5 mm) and two columns: PLGel 5 μm MIXED-C (300 × 7.5 mm) and Malvern Viscotek T6000M (300 x 8 mm) were used for separation. Measurements were carried out in DMF (HPLC grade) as the eluent containing 10 mMLiBr, at 40 °C with a flow rate of 1 ml/min. 2.7. Light scattering measurements The hydrodynamic diameters (Dh) of particle dispersions were measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS) using a Malvern Zetasizer Nano-S90. After dissolution in DMEM (0.4 mg/ml), samples were placed in PMMA cell and put in the thermostatically-controlled cell compartment of the instrument at 37 ± 0.1 °C. Size measurements were carried out on two samples from five independent runs. 2.8. Zeta potential measurements The surface charges of the polymer matrices were measured in DMEM at 37 ± 0.1 °C. Samples were dissolved (0.04 mg/ml) and placed in a disposable folded capillary cell and put in the thermostatically-controlled cell compartment of the instrument (Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZS). Potential measurements were carried out on two samples from five independent runs. 2.9. Cell culture Malignant melanoma cells (Me45) (Kramer-Marek et al., 2006) were obtained from Maria Sklodowska-Curie Memorial Cancer Center and Institute of Oncology's collection (Gliwice, Poland). Human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) were purchased from ATCC (Cat# ATCC®CRL-9609; Manassas, VA, USA), HaCaT, spontaneously immortalized human epidermal keratinocytes (Cat# 300493, RRID:CVCL_0038) were purchased from CSL Cell Line Service GmbH (Eppelheim, Germany). Neonatal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF) cells were purchased from Lonza (NHDF-Neo, Lonza, Poland). Cells were grown according to the previously described protocols (Bielas et al., 2019; Nackiewicz et al., 2019; Gogler-Pigłowska et al., 2018), in humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37 °C, in DMEM F-12 medium (PAA, Poland) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated FBS (Eurx, Poland) and 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany). 2.10. Drugs preparation for biological tests Methotrexate's (S2-MTX and S5-MTX) and acitretin's (S2-AC) conjugates were tested in the conventional MTT assay on HaCaT cells, followed by 48 h of incubation an IC50 parameter was calculated for each co-polymer, and for S2-MTX IC50 = 4 μM; S5-MTX IC50 = 8 μM and for S2-AC IC50 = 4 μM, respectively. For biological tests for each conjugates S2-MTX, S5-MTX and S2-AC, both concentrations of 4 and 8 μM were prepared in fresh complete DMEM-F12 culture medium. The conjugates concentrations were chosen followed by the IC50 calculations (the concentration of drug causing 50% reduction of cells proliferation) from the dose-effect curve using CalcuSyn Version 2.0 (DoseEffect Analyzer for Single and Multiple Drugs software; BIOSOFT) (Skonieczna et al., 2020). Toxicity of un-conjugated polymers was assessed in the range of concentration 0.5–32 μM (Supplementary file 1). 2.11. MTT cytotoxicity assay For MTT assays, cells were plated 24 h before drugs treatment onto 96-well plates at 1x104 cells/well in 0.2 ml medium. The maximal cell confluence was around 60%. Appropriate controls, ethanol or DMSO in fresh medium when used, were prepared. Cells were incubated with compounds for 48 h, and subsequently the solutions were removed, cells washed with physiological saline (1 x PBS; PAA, Poland) and incubated with MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) solution (50 μl of 0.5 mg/ml in RPMI 1640 without phenol red; Sigma) for 2-3 h. After MTT solution was removed the formazan crystals were dissolved in 75 μl of isopropanol:HCl (v/v 1:0.04) mixture. The absorbance of formazan product was read at 570 nm using microplate reader (Epoch; BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA). The experiment was conducted in three independent repetitions, with six technical repeats for each tested concentrations and results were expressed as survival fraction [%] of the control. 2.12. Apoptosis and cell cycle analyses by flow cytometry The fraction of dead cells was detected 48 h after treatment with the study compound using an Annexin-V apoptosis assay (BioLegend, San Diego, Cal., USA) and propidium iodide (PI) solution (100 μg/ml; Sigma) uptake test. Cells collected from the plates after centrifugation (3 min, 0.6 g, RT) and supernatant removal, were suspended in 50 μl of cold Annexin-V labeling buffer and stained with FITF-labeled AnnexinV antibody for 20 min (2.5 μl). Next, cells were incubated in the dark with 10 μl of PI for 20 min. 250 μl of Annexin-V labeling buffer was then added and samples were incubated in the dark on ice for 15 min (Nackiewicz et al., 2019). Cytometric analyses were performed immediately using an Aria III flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson; USA) with the FITC configuration (488 nm excitation; emission: LP mirror 503, BP filter 530/30) or PE configuration (547 nm excitation; emission: 585 nm) and at least 10,000 cells were counted, as reported previously (Nackiewicz et al., 2019). For cell cycle analysis the cells were fixed with 0.6 ml of ice-cold 70% ethanol and stored at −20 °C. Prior to analysis, cells were washed with PBS (500 μl) and then resuspended in 50 μl of RNAse solution. After 20 min of incubation at room temperature, cells were stained with 250 μl of PI 100 μg/ml in PBS (Sigma) and DNA content was assessed by fluorescence measurements via FACS using a PE configuration (547 nm excitation laser line; emission: 585 nm) (Czerwińska et al., 2017). 2.13. Skin biopsy and in vitro assay Postsurgical samples of normal human skin were taken from healthy female patients undergoing abdominoplasty at Euroklinika, Plastic Surgery Clinic, Katowice, Poland. The protocol was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Maria Skłodowska-Curie Institute – Oncology Center, Gliwice Branch, and donors provided written informed consent. Immediately after surgical excision, skin samples were submerged in sterile HBSS buffer supplemented with antibiotic-antimycotic solution and prepared within 6 h. Adipose tissue was mechanically removed, full-thickness skin explants were cut into 1 cm2 pieces and then immediately used for in vitro skin permeability assays, which were then used for co-cultivation experimental system (6-wells plates and inserts 0,4 μm LD for 6-well plates; Becton Dickinson). Inserts with skin fragments were added to the lower chambers which were pre-filled with complete DMEM-F12 fresh medium. Only the bottoms of inserts were constantly immersed in media, whereas the upper part, with skin fragment, was nourished by capillary forces. The epidermis was covered with 50 μl of S2-MTX, S5-MTX and S2-AC at concentration of 8 μM and sealed with a sterile fragment of parafilm to avoid evaporation (Fig. 1). The entire experimental system was then incubated in standard culturing conditions for next 48 h, followed by fixation and staining on each of the skin fragments according to the protocol described below. 2.14. Histopathologic examination After 48 h, skins samples incubated with S2-MTX, S5-MTX and S2- AC in the co-cultivation system were fixed in 4% formaldehyde, embedded in paraffin and cut into 5 μm sections. The sections were further stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and examined microscopically by a light microscopy for any histopathological changes. 2.15. Statistical analyses The results are expressed as means ± S.D. from three independent experiments with statistical significance indicated by * in comparison to untreated controls, calculated with T-test and P-value < 0.05. The cytometric results were analyzed using the free software FlowingSoftware 2.5.0 (PerttuTerho, Turku Centre for Biotechnology, University of Turku, Finland) and are presented as mean fluorescence. Results were analyzed in MS Excel 2010. 3. RESULTS 3.1. Synthesis and characterization of polymer-drug conjugates Well-defined linear (L) and star-shaped (S) polymer-drug conjugates were obtained by ester bond formation between hydroxyl pending groups in polymeric chains and carboxyl groups in MTX (L-MTX, S1- MTX – S5-MTX) or AC (L-AC, S2-AC), using DMAP and CMPI as catalysts (Fig. 2). The successful conjugation of MTX and AC was confirmed via spectroscopy and chromatography analyses. Table 1 presents the physicochemical characterization of the DMAEMA/HEMA copolymers varying molar fraction of HEMA (FHEMA), which the hydroxyl pending group was used in conjugation. The number-average molecular weights of star-shaped copolymers (S1–S5) calculated from conversions of monomers (Mn, GC) were in the range 29600–41600 g/mol. Whereas, Mn values obtained from SEC analysis (Mn, SEC) were two or three folds higher (Table 1). The difference of hydrodynamic volumes between PS standards and branched DMAEMA/HEMA copolymers caused the increase of Mn, SEC values in comparison with theoretical ones. It has to be emphasized that the obtained Mn, SEC values are apparent values because of the use of linear standards for conventional calibration. The dispersity indices (Đ) were in the range 1.22–1.88 and stayed at the same level or decreased after conjugation of the drug. The results of the drug conjugation, as well as the physicochemical characterization of polymer-drug conjugates, are presented in Table 2. The efficacy of drug conjugation (E) and an average number of drug molecules per one macromolecule (ndrug) were calculated from the UV–Vis and verified by 1 H NMR spectra analysis (Fig. 3 and Fig. 4). The average number of conjugated MTX molecules per one star-shaped macromolecule was 11–25 and depended on the polymer chain composition. In the case of AC, the efficacy of the conjugation reaction with the exemplary star-shaped carrier was lower than with MTX (ES2- MTX = 37% vs. ES2-AC = 7%) but higher for copolymer with linear topology (EL-MTX = 44% vs. EL-AC = 100%). The sizes of the polymethacrylic particles measured in DMEM were within the range of 7–12 nm. However, after conjugation of a drug, corresponding polymethacrylate prodrugs at times show a tendency to agglomerate into larger structures with a hydrodynamic diameter around 1500 nm (S5-MTX). The zeta potential (ZP) measurements revealed that bare DMAEMA/HEMA copolymers and corresponding polymer-drug conjugates exhibited positive ZP values due to the presence of tertiary amine groups in DMAEMA repeating units. 3.2. Cellular death after conjugates treatment in vitro Cytometric evaluation revealed that the effect of the tested conjugates, methotrexate S2-MTX, S5-MTX and acitretin S2-AC at 4 μM for 48 h, did not significantly alter the cell cycle phase distribution in comparison to the untreated control populations of NHDF or HaCaT cells (Fig. 5; A and B). However, epithelial bronchial BEAS-2B cells were the most sensitive to the tested conjugates, showing elevated subG1 cellular fraction following 48 h treatment (Fig. 5; C). Further, these cells morphologically presented as damaged, necrotic, and apoptotic. Melanoma Me45 cells, were arrested in G0/G1 phase, which may suggest a cytostatic potential of the prodrugs (Fig. 5; D). Non-toxic effects against NHDF and HaCaT cells were observable after 48 h of treatment with 8 μM (Fig. 6; A and B) with minimal damage effects observed for BEAS-2B cells (Fig. 6; C). Cell cycle arrest in Me45 cancer cells was maintained after 48 h of incubation with 8 μM S2-MTX, S5- MTX and S2-AC conjugates (Fig. 6; D). Analysis of the sub-G1 fraction of cells indicates a presence of damaged cells containing fragmented DNA but little further information. Therefore, we used the Annexin-V apoptosis assay to characterize the type of cell death induced by S2-MTX, S5-MTX and S2-AC conjugates. This assay allows distinction of necrotic from apoptotic sub-populations of cells, where PI positive and Annexin-V negative stained cells are necrotic; PI positive and Annexin-V positive are late necrotic; PI negative and Annexin-V positive are early apoptotic; and PI negative with Annexin-V negative are normal healthy cells. After 48 h of incubation, no necrotic cells were detectable in NHDF, HaCaT and BEAS-2B cells (Fig. 7; A, B and C). Alternatively, Me45 cells, after S2-MTX treatments at both doses (4 and 8 μM), presented as necrotic (Fig. 7; D). Annexin-V staining showed that after S2-MTX, S5-MTX and S2-AC treatments apoptosis was induced in HaCaT cells with no apoptosis increase in NHDF, BEAS-2B and Me45 cell lines (Fig. 7; A, B, C and D). Tissue origin-dependent apoptotic induction in response to the tested prodrugs was visible when comparing the cell lines. Normal skin cells, namely fibroblasts and keratinocytes, possessed higher apoptotic fractions, with around 5% in control untreated sub-populations (Fig. 8; A and B). The most sensitive cells, BEAS-2B, in addition to the 5% detection of apoptotic cells, also showed a 5% necrotic fraction (Fig. 8; C). In melanoma cells, no apoptotic fraction was detectable (Fig. 8; D). Finally, the results of the MTT assay obtained following 48 h of treatment with conjugates showed minimal toxicity against normal cells NHDF, HaCaT and BEAS-2B (Fig. 9; A, B and C). This indicated an insignificant impact of the prodrugs on the cell viability and metabolic activity. However, each of tested conjugates, S2-MTX, S5-MTX and S2- AC, at both doses (4 and 8 μM), significantly reduced the viability of Me45 cancer cells (Fig. 9; D). Decreased metabolic activities observed in the treated Me45 cells, were consistent with the results obtained from Annexin-V apoptosis assay and possibly represent an increased fraction of necrotic cells after 48 h treatment (Fig. 8; C and 9; C). 3.3. Conjugates evaluation in skin co-incubation The histological analysis of skin samples incubated with conjugates S2-MTX, S5-MTX and S2-AC for 48 h revealed no difference in comparison with the control skin sample. In all tested groups, skin explants maintained normal architecture of epidermis and dermis layers. The epidermis layer consists of differentiated layers including basal, spinous, granular and stratum corneum (Wickett and Visscher, 2006). At the cellular level neither apoptotic nor necrotic cells were detected. Thus, skin samples incubated with conjugates of methotrexate (i.e. S2- MTX and S5-MTX) or acitretin (S2-AC), for 2 days were unchanged at histological level (Fig. 10). 4. Discussion The most common polymeric carriers used in drug delivery systems are represented by synthetic polymers such as poly[N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide], poly(ethylene glycol), poly(N-vinyl pyrrolidone), polyethyleneimine, poly(N-isopropylacrylamide), poly(aspartamides), as well as natural polymers - poly(glutamic acid), dextran, chitosan, poly(l-lysine) (Liechty, W. B., Kryscio, D.R., Slaughter, B. V. and Peppas, 2010). The functional groups most frequently used in the design of polymer-drug conjugates include hydroxyl, carboxyl, carbonyl, phosphate/phosphonic and amino groups (Rautio et al., 2008). Another way to introduce vitamins and their derivatives into the polymeric structure is to use them as initiators of polymerization (Batchelor et al., 2017; Odrobińska and Neugebauer, 2019). Herein the presented results concern the chemical attachment of methotrexate or acitretin to the polymeric carriers by means of cleavable ester bonding. In contrast to polymer-MTX conjugates (Matrix et al., 1994; Shin et al., 2014; Bernaczek et al., 2019) there are no known examples in the literature concerning polymer-acitretin conjugates with ester linkages. However, there are patents describing the preparation of conjugates of oligo- and polyamines with acidic retinoids, including acitretin, via an amide bond formation (Papaioannou et al., 2004). Chemical binding via an ester linkage was confirmed by 1 H NMR analysis, which showed the presence of drug signals without signals from free carboxyl groups on polymer-drug conjugates spectra (Fig. 2 and Fig. 3). The literature reports that folic acid, which has similar structure to MTX, tends to create mono- and disubstituted derivatives (Puskas et al., 2018). Although results obtained from 1 H NMR analysis confirmed conjugation of MTX, mono- or disubstitution on MTX could not be precisely assigned due to the overlap of the signals belonging to the protons of the groups after conjugation of MTX (i.e. d2) with signals from the polymer (c1 and c2). Therefore, the presence of both forms is acceptable. Moreover, the Mn,SEC of conjugates were higher than corresponding copolymers, indicating successful conjugation of the drug molecules. The conjugates retained their solubility in water, as evidenced by the relatively small particle size measured using DLS (Tables 1 and 2). Unfortunately, the higher contribution of the HEMA repeating units in copolymer indicated polymer aggregation. These results have shown that the lack of aggregation is guaranteed by the high content of DMAEMA in copolymers, especially star-shaped ones, which undergo protonation in an aqueous environment, a result of positively charged macromolecules repelling each other. The small values of ZP measured for copolymers and their conjugates in DMEM are possibly the result of the medium containing inorganic salts, amino acids, vitamins, and other (e.g. D-glucose). The advantages of the presented polymer-drug conjugates are included in their composition, topology and physicochemical properties. Fig. 7.

Means ± S.D. from three independent experiments with statistical significance indicated by * in comparison to untreated controls (blue bars), calculated with T-test and P-value < 0.05. A. Mielanczyk, et al. European Journal of Pharmacology 866 (2020) 172804 8 The core of the star-shaped polymers is a derivative of d-gluconic acid which is a natural compound produced by mammals. Positively charged pH- and thermoresponsive arms with statistically distributed HEMA repeating units guarantee control over the drug release via pH and/or temperature stimuli. Additionally, PHEMA is approved by the FDA. Positive ZP of polymer-drug conjugate nanoparticles enhances accumulation in damaged skin more than particles with a neutral charge (Palmer and DeLouise, 2016). We postulate that star-shaped amphiphilicpolymethacrylates are soft materials and can penetrate the skin barrier more easily. Moreover, polymer-drug conjugates are more stable than micelles or liposomes. Finally, chemical conjugation of the drug enhances therapeutic effect by protection of the drug from degradation and sustained release of a reduced dose of the drug in the keratinocyte layer (local drug delivery not systemic). The results of our previous research showed that DMAEMA/HEMA copolymers tended to create layers that increase the potential of their utilization as transdermal drug delivery systems (Mielańczyk et al., 2018). In vitro evaluation, using NHDF, HaCaT and BEAS-2B model cell lines showed an almost non-toxic effect on human dermal fibroblasts and epidermis & bronchial epithelial cells. However, the addition of the conjugates S2-MTX, S5-MTX and S2-AC resulted in tissue-specific responses. The most selective action was observed in melanoma cell line, Me45, which manifested G0/G1 phase cell cycle arrest (Fig. 5 and 6). This mechanism of action may be beneficial, due to the anticancer properties of methotrexate conjugates and its derivatives (Attari et al., 2019). Among the tested cell lines, cytostatic effects, such as cell cycle arrest, were visible only in the Me45 cancer cells. Novel anticancer drugs, in addition to arresting cell cycle, should also promote apoptosis (Czerwińska et al., 2017). In Me45 cells, cellular death detected by the Annexin-V apoptosis assay indicated necrosis following S2-MTX treatments in both doses (4 and 8 μM) (Fig. 7) but apoptosis was not detected (Fig. 8). MTT viability assay confirmed cytotoxic effects of tested conjugates S2-MTX, S5-MTX and S2-AC, after 48 hs of treatment in Me45 cells (Fig. 9). Side effects could be effectively reduced in combination therapies with usage of methotrexate, this may also be beneficial in various skin disorders (Salem et al., 2019). Results from the assays in normal skin cell lines, NHDF and HaCaT confirmed that the methotrexate and acitretin conjugates did not arrest the cell cycle or cause detectable cytostatic effects (Fig. 5 and 6). Epithelial BEAS-2B cells responded with the highest sub-G1 phase, which indicated their increased sensitivity to the tested pro-drugs (Fig. 5 and 6). This finding also correlated with high necrotic and apoptotic fractions (Fig. 7 and 8). Surprisingly, mitochondrial activity measured by an MTT assay, after 48 hs of incubation, significantly decreased only after S2-AC treatments at the highest concentration (8 μM) in BEAS-2B cells (Fig. 9). Therefore, it seems that the tested conjugates have pro-apoptotic and cytostatic properties in melanoma cells, but not in normal cell lines. The natural features HaCaT cells under standard in vitro conditions has been reported to enhance their sensitivity to the pro-apoptotic, senescence and apoptosis mechanisms of action induced by the pro-drugs (Fig. 8) (Park et al., 2019). Additionally, S2-MTX, S5-MTX and S2-AC at IC50 concentrations (4 and 8 μM) should induce different types of cellular death, including apoptosis, which was observed in this study. Pro-apoptotic action could be used in the further applications, against skin disorders, especially in anticancer applications. Classical H&E staining of skin explants incubated with conjugates S2-MTX, S5-MTX and S2-AC for 48 h showed no difference between tested groups (Fig. 10). MTX as a single agent is used in psoriasis for longer treatment and can cause severe side effects, including painful Fig. 8.

Histological manifestations of these adverse effects were visible via focal dermo-epidermal separation with keratinocyte dystrophy and necrosis. Patients with other diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and bullos pemphigoid, treated with MTX have also presented with skin toxicity related to keratinocytes dystrophy (Alaya et al., 2018; Delyon et al., 2015; Lewis et al., 2017). This dysfunction manifests as keratinocyte dystrophy with histological features similar to cellular hypertrophy, clarified keratinocytes, dyskeratotic cells or cells with irregular shape nuclei (Delyon et al., 2015). However, it is crucial to note the difference between our study and abovementioned histopathological analysis. Our results differ in route and length of drug administration, where patients received MTX at low-doses regimes at least two months our study was only for 48 h. Thus, the presented results indicate absence of both dermal irritation and cell death at initial stage of conjugate administration. Further, a recent study by Abu Hashim and colleagues (Hashim et al., 2018) showed severe to moderate skin irritation with accompanying alterations including keratinocyte necrosis, crust formation, degeneration of stratum spinosum, and spongosium formation with normal dermis and skin appendages in a rat model treated with a gel formulation of acitretin. However, the authors proposed a solution of creating a novel delivery system for acitretin in the form of niosomes which did not introduce histopathological alternations in the skin microstructure and prevented irritation. A second feature of niosomes is that they encapsulate acitretin, avoiding direct carboxyl group contact with stratum corneum, which initiates the irritation process (Hashim et al., 2018). The same mechanism may protect the skin in case of both drugs conjugates where carboxyl groups were used in ester bond formation. 5. Conclusions Water-soluble, nanosized polymethacrylate-MTX and polymethacrylate-AC prodrugs with pH- or enzymatically cleavable ester bonds between the carrier and the drug were developed. Histological analysis of skin samples treated for 48 h with topically administrated conjugates showed no keratinocytes dystrophy or dermal irritation, similar to the in vitro non-toxic effects observed in model cell lines NHDF, HaCaT and BEAS-2B. Melanoma cancer cells, Me45, responded with G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. The developed materials may find application as nanosized polymeric prodrugs for topical treatment of psoriasis in the form of ointments or creams, intravenously treatment, or as matrices in hydrogel patches	Anna Mielanczyka,∗ , Katarzyna Mrowiecb , Maria Kupczaka , Łukasz Mielanczykc , Dorota Scieglinskab , Agnieszka Gogler-Piglowskab , Marek Michalskic , Andrzej Gabrielc , Dorota Neugebauera , Magdalena Skonieczna
2	2019	In vitro evaluation of poloxamer in situ forming gels for bedaquiline fumarate salt and pharmacokinetics following intramuscular injection in rats	The objective of this study was to evaluate in vitro and in vivo drug release from in situ forming gels prepared with poloxamer 338 (P338) and/or 407 (P407) in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP)/water mixtures for the model compound bedaquiline fumarate salt. The impact of total poloxamer concentration (20%–25% (w/w)), P338/ P407 ratio (100/0%–0/100% (w/w)) and NMP/water ratio (0/100%–25/75% (v/v)) on gel point temperature (GPT) was investigated via a design of experiments (DoE), showing that GPT decreased mainly with increasing poloxamer concentration and decreasing P338/P407 ratio, while the relation with NMP/water ratio was more complex resulting in a flexion. Based on the DoE, four formulations with 10 mg/g bedaquiline fumarate salt, a fixed NMP/water ratio of 25/75% (v/v) and varying total poloxamer concentration and P338/P407 ratio were selected for evaluation of gel erosion in vitro. The fastest eroding formulation had the lowest total poloxamer concentration (20% (w/w)) and the lowest P338/P407 ratio (20.4/79.6% (w/w)), while the formulation with the highest total poloxamer concentration (23.5% (w/w)) and highest P338/P407 ratio (100/0% (w/w)) showed the lowest gel erosion rate. These fast and slow eroding formulations showed a similar trend for in vitro drug release and in vivo pharmacokinetics after intramuscular (IM) injection in rats. In vivo tmax of the IM administered poloxamer in situ forming gels was about 6 h and a short-term sustained drug release was observed in vivo in rats up to 24 h after dosing, similar to a solution of bedaquiline fumarate salt in polyethylene glycol (PEG400)/water. In conclusion, IM administration of the evaluated poloxamer in situ forming gels may be useful for drugs that require a short-term sustained release, but is not able to extend drug release rates up to weeks or months. 1. Introduction In drug development, scientists are often confronted with drugs having a short half-life or a low oral bioavailability due to poor solubility, degradation in the gastrointestinal tract or a high first pass effect, necessitating frequent administration. Drugs may also show high peak plasma concentrations, leading to side effects. This results in inconvenience for the patient and low adherence rates, especially for longterm therapies. Long acting injectables (LAIs), such as lipophilic solutions, polymeric microspheres, aqueous micro- or nanosuspensions and in situ forming gels, could help to overcome these challenges. They can provide drug coverage for days to months with a single administration and can be tailored to result in release profiles avoiding side effects or to deliver the drug to a specific target site (Kempe and Mäder, 2012). Compared to microparticulate systems, lipophilic solutions and in situ forming gels with dissolved drug may reduce manufacturing cost and complexity, since particle size control is not necessary and final sterilization may happen via sterile filtration. Poloxamers are copolymers of hydrophilic ethylene oxide (EO) and hydrophobic propylene oxide (PO), arranged in a triblock structure EOx–POy–EOx with the chemical formula HO[CH2–CH2O]x[CH (CH3)–CH2O]y[CH2–CH2O]xH. The polymer blocks have varying lengths, resulting in different polymers covering a large range of liquids, pastes and solids (Dumortier et al., 2006; Raymond et al., 2006). Commonly used grades include P188, P237, P338 and P407, where “P” stands for paste, the first two digits multiplied by 100 represent the molecular mass of the PO core and the last digit multiplied by 10 corresponds to the weight percentage of EO (Raymond et al., 2006; Ramya Devi et al., 2013; Escobar-Chávez et al., 2006). Poloxamers are widely used as solubilizers, emulsifiers, wetting and dispersing agents in oral, parenteral and topical drug products (Dumortier et al., 2006; Raymond e al., 2006; Ramya Devi et al., 2013; Escobar-Chávez et al., 2006). In addition, they have a reversible thermo-responsive gelling capacity when dissolved in water (Kempe and Mäder, 2012; Dumortier et al., 2006; Raymond et al., 2006; Ramya Devi et al., 2013; Escobar-Chávez et al., 2006). Above the critical micelle temperature (CMT) and critical micelle concentration, the polymer chains aggregate into micelles due to dehydration of the hydrophobic PO blocks. When temperature increases further above the gel point temperature (GPT), the physical entanglement and packing of the micelles results in gel formation for sufficiently concentrated poloxamer solutions (Dumortier et al., 2006; Ramya Devi et al., 2013; Escobar-Chávez et al., 2006). This characteristic is especially interesting when formulating thermally-induced in situ forming gel systems. At room temperature, the gelling systems are in a liquid state, while they form a gel at body temperature, after injection (Kempe and Mäder, 2012). Several parenteral short-term sustained release formulations have been explored using this technology. Compared to conventional injectable solutions, delayed and/or reduced peak plasma concentrations or increased half-lives were reported for poloxamer in situ forming gels, extending drug exposures up to a few days (Kempe and Mäder, 2012; Zhang et al., 2002; Yu et al., 2014; Shi et al., 2015; Jabarian et al., 2013; Bhardwaj and Blanchard, 1996; Zhang et al., 2015; Veyries et al., 1999). Release of drug substance from the gel matrix happens via gel erosion, i.e. dissolution of the polymers from the gel surface, and/or diffusion (Anderson et al., 2001). These processes are determined by the characteristics of the drug substance and formulation factors like type and concentration of the gel forming polymers and the presence of additives (e.g. co-solvents, hypromellose, carboxymethylcellulose, …) (Kempe and Mäder, 2012; Zhang et al., 2002). After dissolution from the in situ forming gel depot, poloxamers are cleared almost entirely by renal excretion, with limited metabolism (Grindel, 2002). In this research work, in vitro and in vivo drug release from in situ forming gels prepared with poloxamer 338 (P338) and/or 407 (P407) in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP)/water mixtures were evaluated for the model compound bedaquiline fumarate salt. Poloxamers were selected as gel formers based on their wide use in drug products, including parenterals, their low cost, high water solubility, low toxicity and known thermogelling behaviour (Kempe and Mäder, 2012; Dumortier et al., 2006; Raymond et al., 2006; Ramya Devi et al., 2013; Escobar-Chávez et al., 2006). NMP was added as co-solvent for its high solubilizing capacity and water miscibility (Sanghvi et al., 2008). It is also used as solvent in FDA approved parenteral drug products like Eligard® and Sublocade®, which are formulated as subcutaneous in situ forming gels with poly-(DL-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) polymers (Drug label 2018; Drug label information 2019). Bedaquiline fumarate salt was chosen as model compound based on its physicochemical characteristics. The compound is highly lipophilic (logD = 5.1) and very slightly soluble to practically insoluble in aqueous media at pH 1.5 to 13, as many drugs in development. It inhibits the proton pump of M. tuberculosis adenosine 5′ triphosphate (ATP) synthase and is marketed for the treatment of multi drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). The commercial formulation is a 120.9 mg (equivalent to 100 mg bedaquiline free base) immediate release tablet, showing peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) about 5 h after dosing, followed by a tri-exponential decline in plasma concentrations with a terminal half-life of approximately 5 months, likely reflecting slow release from peripheral tissues (Summary of Product Characteristics Sirturo 100 mg tablets, 2018). Human pharmacokinetics are dose proportional up to doses of 700 mg. The advised treatment duration for MDR-TB is 24 weeks, which makes it interesting to explore LAIs. While bedaquiline would especially benefit from release rates covering weeks to months, poloxamer in situ forming gels have shown drug exposures up to a few days only, which makes them more suitable for drugs requiring a short-term sustained release (Kempe and Mäder, 2012; Zhang et al., 2002; Yu et al., 2014; Shi et al., 2015; Jabarian et al., 2013; Bhardwaj and Blanchard, 1996; Zhang et al., 2015; Veyries et al., 1999). First, the impact of total poloxamer concentration, ratio of poloxamer grades P338/P407 and concentration of the co-solvent NMP on GPT of poloxamer formulations was investigated via a central composite design. In a next step, the gel erosion and in vitro release were determined for selected poloxamer formulations containing bedaquiline fumarate salt. Finally, the pharmacokinetics of bedaquiline were evaluated for two in situ forming gel formulations after intramuscular (IM) injection to the rat and compared to those of a solution in polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG400)/water after both IM and intravenous (IV) injection. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Materials Bedaquiline fumarate salt and purified water originated from Janssen Pharmaceutica NV (Beerse, Belgium). P338 and P407 were bought from BASF (Mannheim, Germany) and PEG400 from Clariant (Frankfurt am Main, Germany). NMP was obtained from Acros Organics (New Jersey, USA). Water for injections was sourced from Baxter (Lessines, Belgium) or Sterop Laboratoria (Brussels, Belgium). All other chemicals were of reagent grade and purchased from commercial sources. 2.2. Formulation preparations Poloxamer placebo formulations were prepared applying the “cold method” (Schmolka and Artificial skin, 1972). Poloxamer was added to solvent (water or NMP/water mixtures) cooled to 5 °C. The mixture was stored in the refrigerator and periodically stirred until a clear solution was obtained. Poloxamer formulations containing 10 mg/g bedaquiline fumarate salt were prepared according to the same method, adding bedaquiline fumarate salt to the poloxamer solution as a stock solution of 100 mg/mL in NMP. For the 5 mg eq./mL bedaquiline fumarate salt formulation in PEG400/water 50/50% (v/v), the drug substance was dissolved in PEG400 and further diluted with water. Formulations administered to rats were prepared with water for injections and filtered through a 0.22 µm Sterivex sterile filter. For other formulations, purified water was used. 2.2.1. Formulations for gel point temperature design of experiments For the GPT design of experiments (DoE), eight placebo formulations were prepared as factorial points covering all combinations of a total poloxamer concentration of 20% or 25% (w/w), a P338/P407 ratio of 0/100% or 100/0% (w/w) and a NMP/water ratio of 0/100% or 25/75% (v/v). Six placebo formulations represented the face centered axial points with a total poloxamer concentration of 20% or 25% (w/w), a P338/P407 ratio of 50/50% (w/w) and a NMP/water ratio of 12.5/87.5% (v/v), with a total poloxamer concentration of 22.5% (w/ w), a P338/P407 ratio of 0/100% or 100/0% (w/w) and a NMP/water ratio of 12.5/87.5% (v/v), and with a total poloxamer concentration of 22.5% (w/w), a P338/P407 ratio of 50/50% (w/w) and a NMP/water ratio of 0/100% or 25/75% (v/v). The center point placebo formulation contained a total poloxamer concentration of 22.5% (w/w), a P338/ P407 ratio of 50/50% (w/w) and a NMP/water ratio of 12.5/87.5% (v/ v). The ranges applied for the DoE were based on visual gel formation evaluations of a series of poloxamer placebo formulations. 2.2.2. Formulations for gel erosion study Based on the GPT DoE, formulations 1, 2, 3 and 4 containing 10 mg/ g bedaquiline fumarate salt were prepared in NMP/water 25/75% (v/v) with a total poloxamer content of 23.5%, 20.0%, 20.0% or 21.9% (w/ w) and a P338/P407 ratio of 100/0%, 20.4/79.6%, 47.7/52.3% or 57.3/42.7% (w/w), respectively. The selected formulations were combinations of a fixed NMP/water ratio of 25/75% (v/v) to allow dissolution of bedaquiline fumarate salt and maximized or minimized total poloxamer concentration and P338/P407 ratio, resulting in a GPT of 26–30 °C, a range which was based on visual gel formation evaluations. 2.2.3. Formulations for in vitro release study Based on the gel erosion study, formulations 1 and 2 containing 10 mg/g bedaquiline fumarate salt were prepared in NMP/water 25/ 75% (v/v) with a total poloxamer content of 23.5% or 20.0% (w/w) and a P338/407 ratio of 100/0% or 20.4/79.6% (w/w), respectively, as described in Section 2.2.2. 2.2.4. Formulations for in vivo pharmacokinetic study in rats Formulations 1 and 2 described under Section 2.2.3 and their corresponding placebo formulations, vehicle 1 and 2, were prepared for the pharmacokinetic study in rats. In addition, formulation 5 of 5 mg eq./mL bedaquiline fumarate salt in PEG400/water 50/50% (v/v) was used. 2.3. In vitro evaluations 2.3.1. Gel point temperature design of experiments The impact of NMP/water ratio (0/100%–25/75% (v/v)), total poloxamer concentration (20%–25% (w/w)), and P338/P407 ratio (0/ 100%–100/0% (w/w)) on GPT of the poloxamer placebo formulations was investigated through a central composite design with 8 factorial points, 6 axial points and 4 replicates of the center point. The GPT was determined on a HAAKE rheostress rheometer (Waltham, Massachusetts, USA) applying an oscillatory temperature-ramp measurement (Peltier system) at a frequency of f = 1 Hz and a temperature increase of ΔT/t = 0.06666 °C/s. The software Design expert 10 (StatEase Inc., USA) was used to establish and analyze the design of experiments. A quadratic response surface model, with 9 degrees of freedom (model terms minus the intercept), was fitted to describe the GPT data. Backward selection was used for model reduction purposes based on a p-value < 0.05 for significant terms. 2.3.2. Gel erosion study The gel erosion study was performed in duplicate for in situ forming gel formulations 1–4. 5 g of the formulation was added to a 20 mL amber glass vial and equilibrated at 37 °C for at least 30 min to allow gel formation. Then, 1 mL of 0.133 M Sørensen’s phosphate buffer of pH 7.2 and 37 °C, was added to the vial to mimick muscle fluid (Juel, 2008; Recipe Sorensen’s phosphate buffer, 2010). After time intervals of 30 min (for time points up to 2 h) or 1 h (for time points from 2 to 7 h), the buffer was removed, the vial with remaining gel was weighed and 1 mL of fresh buffer was added to the vial. Gel weight loss was calculated to determine the gel erosion rate. 2.3.3. In vitro release study The in vitro release study was performed in triplicate for in situ forming gel formulations 1 and 2 on a Distek USP paddle apparatus 2 with 6 dissolution vessels. 2.2 g of the formulation was added to a cylindric plastic cup and equilibrated at 37 °C to allow gel formation. The cup was then transferred to a dissolution vessel containing 900 mL 0.05 M phosphate buffer pH 7.4 with 1% (w/v) sodium lauryl sulphate at 37 °C and a paddle rotating at 50 rpm. Samples were collected at 5, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, 300, 360 and 1440 min after introducing the formulation into the dissolution vessel by extracting 3.5 mL of dissolution medium through a Distek needle connected to a 5 mL syringe. The collected dissolution medium was filtered through a 30 mm × 0.2 µm Spartan Whatman filter and stored at room temperature until analysis (see Section 2.3.4). This set-up is commonly used for in vitro release testing of drug products and represents sink conditions. 2.3.4. Analytical method for the in vitro release study The quantification of bedaquiline in the in vitro release samples was conducted on a Waters Acquity H-Class UHPLC system (Zellik, Belgium) with an ultraviolet (UV) absorbance detector set at 334 nm and a Waters Acquity CSH C18 1.7 µm 2.1 × 50 mm column kept at 45 °C. Sample injection volume was 3 µL. Gradient elution was applied for 3 min at a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min using a mobile phase of (A) 0.1% (v/ v) trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in water and (B) 0.05% (v/v) TFA in acetonitrile (ACN). The percentage of (B) TFA in ACN was increased from 10% at time zero to 90% at 1 min, kept stable at 90% until 1.5 min, reduced to 10% at 2 min and kept stable at 10% until 3 min. Data were processed via Waters Empower 3 software. 2.4. In vivo pharmacokinetic study in rats 2.4.1. Animals Pharmacokinetic evaluation was performed in Sprague Dawley rats supplied by Charles River (Sulzfeld, Germany) with a body weight of 300 to 350 g and age of 9–11 weeks at the start of the study. The rats were group housed in polysulphon cages with corn cob bedding material, Rodent retreat (Bio-Serv, USA) and Aspen wood block (Datesand, UK) environmental enrichment in airconditioned (20–24 °C) rooms with a 12 h light cycle. They were acclimatized for at least 4 days before the study start and had free access to food and water during the entire experimental period. All experimental procedures involving animals were conducted following the guidelines of the Janssen Pharmaceutica (Beerse, Belgium) Animal Ethics Committee and the local Belgium laws controlling the use of experimental animals as well as EC Directive 2010/63/EU. 2.4.2. Pharmacokinetics 23 rats were allocated to five groups (4 animals for group 1 and 2, 6 animals for group 3 and 4 and 3 animals for group 5) based on body weight (Table 1). In group 1 and 2, rats were dosed twice 0.363 mL/kg of vehicle 1 and 2, respectively, via intramuscular (IM) injection in the left and right hind leg. Similar injections of formulation 1 and 2 were administered to rats of groups 3 and 4, respectively, corresponding to a dose of twice 3 mg eq./kg. Rats of group 5 received an IV injection of 1 mL/kg, or a dose of 5 mg eq./kg, of formulation 5 in the vena saphena, followed by two IM injections of 0.3 mL/kg of formulation 5 14 days later, each delivering a dose of 1.5 mg eq./kg in the left and right hind leg. 32 µL blood samples were collected in Vitrex micro hematocrit tubes “soda lime glass” with potassium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (K2.EDTA) by puncture of the tail vein of the rats at specified timepoints ranging from 0.5 h to 28 days after IM dosing of groups 1 to 4 and from 0.25 to 80 h post IV and IM dosing of group 5. For groups 1 to 4, 1 rat was sacrificed at intermediate timepoints on days 1, 4 and 8 (after pharmacokinetic sampling at 2 h, 80 h and 168 h) for histological evaluation (see Section 2.4.3). Therefore, the number of rats with pharmacokinetic data in groups 3 and 4 was 6, 5, 4 and 3 up to timepoints of 2 h, 80 h, 168 h and 672 h, respectively. After sampling, blood samples were immediately placed on melting ice and centrifuged at 5 °C, 1500×g for approximately 10 min. Then, 10 µL plasma aliquots were collected with Vitrex end to end pipettes in FluidX tubes and stored in the freezer until analysis (see Section 2.4.4). Non-compartmental analysis was performed to calculate pharmacokinetic parameters using the validated computer program Phoenix™ WinNonlin® (Certara L.P., USA). Statistical comparisons between groups were performed using a two-tailed homoscedastic t-test. 2.4.3. Histology Histological evaluation was performed for rats of groups 1 to 4. In each group, 1 rat was evaluated at intermediate timepoints on day 1, 4 and 8 (after pharmacokinetic sampling at 2 h, 80 h and 168 h). On day 29 (after pharmacokinetic sampling at 672 h), the remaining rats were examined, being 1 rat for groups 1 and 2 and 3 rats for groups 3 and 4. The entire left hind leg or limb muscle group containing the IM administration site of the rats was collected at necropsy and fixed in 10% buffered formalin. Since the gel was colourless, a standardized sampling of the administration site was performed. Sagittal cross sections of the formalin-fixed administration sites were embedded in paraffin wax, sectioned and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). All microscopic slides were examined histopathologically by a board-certified pathologist and the findings entered directly into a computerized database (Ascentos, Pathology Data Systems Limited, Pratteln, Basel, Switzerland). 2.4.4. Bioanalytical method for pharmacokinetics Plasma levels of bedaquiline were determined for pharmacokinetic samples of groups 3 to 5 using a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) system consisting of a Shimadzu LC30AD HPLC equipment with an SIL-HTC autosampler (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments, MD, USA), coupled to an API4000™ triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (AB Sciex, Toronto, Canada) equipped with Turbo Ionspray source operated at 400 °C. Plasma samples were processed by adding subsequently 20 µL milliQ water, 20 µL methanol, 20 µL internal standard solution and 200 µL of ACN to the capillaries in the FluidX tubes. The internal standard solution consisted of 6-deuterium labeled bedaquiline at 100 ng/mL in methanol. After closing, the tubes were shaken horizontally for 10 min on an orbital shaker and centrifuged for 3 min at 2500g. The supernatant (150 µL) was transferred to a 96- deepwell plate and 1 µL of the sample extracts was injected onto a Waters BEH C18 50 × 2.1 mm, 1.7 µm column. Gradient elution was applied for 4 min at a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min using a mobile phase of (A) 0.01 M ammonium formate pH 4.0 and (B) methanol. The percentage of (B) methanol was increased from 65% at time zero to 85% at 1.25 min, to 98% at 1.30 min, kept stable at 98% until 2.49 min, reduced to 65% at 2.50 min and kept stable at 65% until 4 min. Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) transitions were monitored for bedaquiline (555.2 → 58 m/z) and the internal standard (561.2 → 64 m/z) applying a collision energy of 71 eV. 3. Results 3.1. In vitro evaluations 3.1.1. Gel point temperature design of experiments The GPT determined by rheology for the 18 DoE runs defined for the factors NMP/water ratio (factor A), total poloxamer content (factor B) and P338/P407 ratio (factor C) is shown in Table 2. The model equation built on significant terms is shown below: GPT = 38.3 + (1.76 * NMP/water ratio) − (0.770 * Total poloxamer concentration) + (0.184 * P338/P407 ratio) − (0.0715 * NMP/ water ratio * Total poloxamer concentration) + (2.51.10−3 * NMP/ water ratio * P338/P407 ratio) − (3.94.10−3 * Total poloxamer concentration * P338/P407 ratio) − (0.0135 * NMP/water ratio2 ) − (3.22.10−4 * P338/P407 ratio2 ) GPT was significantly positively correlated with NMP/water ratio, P338/P407 ratio, and the interaction between those two factors. GPT was significantly negatively correlated with total poloxamer concentration, with the quadratic terms of NMP/water ratio and P338/ P407 ratio and with the interactions between total poloxamer concentration and NMP/water ratio or P338/P407 ratio. Figs. 1A and 1B show a 3-dimensional (3D) surface plot for a P338/ P407 ratio of 50/50% (w/w) and total poloxamer concentration of 22.5% (w/w), respectively. In Fig. 1A, GPT decreased with increasing total poloxamer concentration, as all total poloxamer concentration terms in the DoE model equation showed a negative correlation with GPT. Fig. 1B shows an increase in GPT with increasing P338/P407 ratio. This trend was confirmed throughout the design space and was mainly driven by the positively correlated individual term P338/P407 ratio and its interaction with NMP/water ratio, while the interaction with total poloxamer concentration and the quadratic term were negatively correlated with GPT. In both Figs. 1A and 1B and within the design space, the relation between GPT and NMP/water ratio was rather complex, showing an inflection point. 3.1.2. Gel erosion study The formulations evaluated for gel erosion with their corresponding GPT are described in Table 3. They were selected based on the DoE model equation described in Section 3.1.1 using Design expert 10 (StatEase Inc., USA). While fixing the NMP/water ratio of 25/75% (v/v), 4 combinations of maximized or minimized total poloxamer concentration and P338/P407 ratio were defined, resulting in a GPT of 26–30 °C. The high NMP/water ratio was selected to allow solubility of 10 mg/g bedaquiline fumarate salt and the GPT range was defined based on visual gel formation tests, ensuring adequate gel formation at body temperature. The gel erosion, expressed as percentage weight loss (% (w/w)) as a function of time, is shown in Fig. 2. The slowest gel erosion rates (24–25% after 7 h) were observed for formulation 1 with the highest total poloxamer concentration of 23.5% (w/w) and a P338/P407 ratio of 100/0% (w/w), and formulation 4 with a total poloxamer concentration of 21.9% (w/w) and a P338/P407 ratio of 57.3/42.7% (w/w). Formulations 2 and 3 with a lower total poloxamer concentration of 20% (w/w) eroded faster, with the fastest gel weight loss (51% after 7 h) observed for formulation 2 with the lower P338/P407 ratio and lower GPT as compared to formulation 3. Up to 2 h, with buffer refreshments every 30 min, the weight loss curves were steeper than from 2 to 7 h, for which buffer refreshments happened hourly. Upon or after collection of the buffer samples, a precipitation was observed in the buffer, corresponding to the Raman spectrum of bedaquiline fumarate salt. As the experimental set-up was designed to evaluate gel erosion rates and sink conditions for in vitro release of bedaquiline fumarate salt were not guaranteed, quantification of bedaquiline fumarate salt via UHPLC was not performed in the buffer samples. Instead, an in vitro release study was executed in sink conditions as described in Section 3.1.3. 3.1.3. In vitro release study The in vitro release was determined for formulations 1 and 2 representing the slowest and fastest gel erosion rate, respectively, as described in Section 3.1.2. The in vitro release profiles are shown in Fig. 3. Formulation 1 with the slowest gel erosion rate in Section 3.1.2 corresponded to the slower in vitro release profile, while formulation 2 showed the higher gel erosion and in vitro release rate. Formulations 1 and 2 reached more than 100% in vitro release after 5 and 4 h, respectively. The 107% release at the end of the profiles was in line with the assay of the formulations, being 104%. 3.2. In vivo pharmacokinetic study in rats 3.2.1. Pharmacokinetics In situ forming gel formulations 1 and 2, evaluated for in vitro release in Section 3.1.3, were administered to rats via IM injection in the left and right hind legs, corresponding to a bedaquiline fumarate salt dose of 6 mg eq./kg. In addition, PEG400 solution formulation 5 was administered to rats via IV injection at a dose of 5 mg eq./kg and via IM injection in both hind legs delivering a dose of 3 mg eq./kg. The mean pharmacokinetic profiles are shown in Fig. 4. Mean pharmacokinetic parameters are summarized in Table 4. After single parenteral administration of bedaquiline fumarate salt to male rats, plasma concentrations of bedaquiline were quantifiable up to the last sampling points, i.e. 672 h post-dose at 6 mg eq./kg IM dosing of in situ forming gel formulations 1 and 2 and 80 h post-dose at 3 mg eq./kg IM and 5 mg eq./kg IV dosing of PEG400 solution formulation 5. After IM dosing of the formulations 1, 2 and 5, peak concentrations were observed around 6 h post-dose. Formulation 2 showed a significantly higher Cmax (p value < 0.001) and faster initial drop after reaching peak concentrations (p value < 0.01 for slope of logarithmic plasma concentration-time profiles between tmax and 24 h) than formulation 1, suggesting a faster drug absorption or release rate. For all IM formulations, the slopes of the logarithmic plasma concentrationtime profiles between tmax and 24 h were significantly lower than for formulation 5 (IV) between 6 and 24 h (p value < 0.001 for formulation 1, p value < 0.01 for formulations 2 and 5 (IM)). Terminal halflives of formulations 1 and 2 were comparable (p value > 0.05). The half-life calculated for formulation 5 (IM and IV) was much shorter due to the earlier tlast and can therefore not be compared to the half-life of formulations 1 and 2. However, logarithmic plasma concentration-time profiles of formulations 1 and 2 (IM) declined parallel to the ones of formulation 5 (IM and IV) between 24 and 80 h after dosing, suggesting a similar half-life for all formulations within that timeframe. The intersubject variability for pharmacokinetic parameters of formulations 1, 2 and 5 (IM) was limited and varied from 10.3 to 14.3 %CV for Cmax (n = 5 for formulations 1 and 2 and n = 3 for formulation 5) and from 2.7 to 19.5 %CV for AUClast (n = 3 for formulations 1, 2 and 5). The intersubject variability for pharmacokinetic parameters of formulation 5 (IV) was higher and was 49.6 %CV for C0 (n = 3) and 29.9 %CV for AUClast (n = 3). Cmax/Dose values of formulations 1 and 5 (IM) were comparable and lower than for formulation 2 (IM). Based on the AUC80h/Dose values, exposures of formulations 1 and 2 (IM) were comparable and slightly higher than for formulation 5 (IM or IV), which may (partially) be explained by the slightly higher assay of the formulations (104% for 1 and 2 versus 98% for 5). 3.2.2. Histology A single IM injection of in situ forming gel formulations 1 and 2 and their corresponding vehicles to rats, resulted in minimal to slight myofiber degeneration or necrosis, minimal to slight hemorrhage and minimal perivascular granulocytic infiltrates in all groups on day 1. A similar degree of myofiber degeneration or necrosis, microvacuolated histiocytic infiltrates and chronic inflammation was noted on day 4 and 8 after dosing. The only difference between the vehicle and the formulation-dosed groups was the palisading of macrophages around the presumed gel in the formulation-dosed groups on day 8 (Fig. 5). At day 29 recovery was almost complete, only a minimal myofiber regeneration, minimal histiocytic infiltrates or minimal chronic inflammation was noted for individual rats in both vehicle- and formulation- dosed groups. 4. Discussion The GPT DoE investigated the impact of total poloxamer concentration (20%–25% (w/w)), P338/P407 ratio (0/100%–100/0% (w/ w)) and NMP/water ratio (0/100%–25/75% (v/v)) on the GPT of poloxamer placebo formulations. It was shown that GPT decreased with increasing total poloxamer concentration via the negatively correlated DoE model equation terms “total poloxamer concentration” and its interaction with P338/407 or NMP/water ratio. This is in line with the observations of A. Fakhari et al for P407 gels (Fakhari, 2017) and can be explained by the fact that the polymer chains are packed more densely at higher concentrations, lowering the energy needed to result in dehydration and consequent gelation of the polymer chains. Within the evaluated design space, GPT showed an increase with increasing P338/P407 ratio, mainly driven by the positively correlated individual term P338/P407 ratio and its interaction with NMP/water ratio, while the interaction with total poloxamer concentration and the quadratic term were negatively correlated with GPT. The overall positive correlation is in line with the shorter polyethylene oxide (PEO) polymer chains and lower GPT reported for poloxamer P407 (BASF and Grades, 2013; Bang, et al., 2015). The relation between GPT and NMP/water ratio was rather complex, with positively and negatively correlated model equation terms, showing an inflection point. A similar observation was described by Phaechamud et al. (2012). At low concentrations, the NMP amide function undergoes mainly hydrophobic interactions, while it interferes strongly with hydrogen bonding at higher concentrations (Zaichikov, 2006; Jia et al., 2014). Both interactions may impact polymer micelle and gel formation, and lead to the complex relation between GPT and NMP/water ratio. Based on the GPT DoE, 4 different formulations were selected with a GPT between 26 and 30 °C to ensure adequate gelation at body temperature and a fixed NMP/water ratio of 25/75% (v/v) to allow dissolution of 10 mg/g bedaquiline fumarate salt. Higher poloxamer concentrations slowed down gel erosion via an increase in number and size of poloxamer micelles, shorter inter-micellar distance and a greater number of cross-links between micelles, causing a greater tortuosity and rigidity of the gel structure (Zhang et al., 2002; Bhardwaj and Blanchard, 1996). A decreasing P338/P407 ratio led to an increased gel erosion rate, which may be attributed to the lower molecular weight of P407 compared to P338, requiring less time for hydration and dissolution of the poloxamer chains. More frequent buffer refreshments led to steeper gel erosion curves. According to the Noyes-Whitney equation (Smith, 2016), the poloxamer dissolution rate could be impacted by the poloxamer concentration gradient, which would be higher for 0.5 than 1 hourly buffer refreshments. In vitro release profiles for the in situ forming gel formulations with lowest (formulation 1) and highest (formulation 2) gel erosion rate followed the same rank order as the gel erosion tests, indicating that gel erosion rate plays a significant role in the drug release. Diffusion of the drug throughout the gel matrix cannot be ruled out, but is expected to have a minimal effect on drug release based on available literature (Zhang et al., 2002; Anderson et al., 2001). Based on the gel erosion and in vitro release profiles, only a shortterm controlled release may be expected in vivo for the prepared poloxamer in situ forming gels. Gels eroded for 24% to 51% within 7 h and in vitro release profiles showed 100% release within 4–5 h. Similar gel erosion and in vitro drug release rates (about 100% after 6 h) were reported by L.

Plasma concentration-time profiles in rat (mean profiles and standard deviation error bars for n = 3 to 5). Red diamond: Intramuscular (IM) in situ forming gel formulation 1 dosed at 6 mg eq./kg (10 mg/g bedaquiline fumarate salt in 23.5% (w/w) containing 25% (w/v) P407 in water (Zhang et al., 2002). Pharmacokinetic data were in line with the gel erosion and in vitro release tests. Both in situ forming gel formulations reached Cmax at about 6 h and formulation 1 showed a slower release than formulation 2. The slope of the logarithmic plasma concentration-time profiles between tmax and 24 h for the in situ gel formulations was lower than the one between 6 and 24 h for formulation 5 (IV), a solution of bedaquiline fumarate salt in PEG400/water, indicating a short-term sustained release. However, a similar short-term release was observed for formulation 5 (IM). The high viscosity of formulation 5 may have caused a slow diffusion of the drug at the injection site. Based on the histological evaluation of the IM administration site, an IM injection of the bedaquiline in situ forming gels and their corresponding vehicles were well tolerated, only a transient inflammatory response was observed with almost complete recovery after 28 days. Johnston and Miller (1985) performed a toxicological evaluation of poloxamer vehicles after IM injection in rabbits, indicating that muscle toxicity was proportional to the lipophilicity of the poloxamer. P407 25% (w/w) showed gross lesions and elevations in creatinine phosphokinase comparable to normal saline and was considered an acceptable intramuscular vehicle (Johnston and Miller, 1985). P338 is not expected to be more toxic than P407, since it is less lipophilic. 5. Conclusions In this study, the in vitro and in vivo drug release of in situ forming gels containing 10 mg/g bedaquiline fumarate salt, P338 and/or P407, NMP and purified water was evaluated. Keeping the NMP/water ratio fixed at 25/75% (v/v), the formulation with the lowest total poloxamer concentration (20% (w/w)) and the lowest P338/P407 ratio (20.4/ 79.6% (w/w)) showed the highest gel erosion rate; while the one with the highest total poloxamer concentration (23.5% (w/w)) and highest P338/P407 ratio (100/0% (w/w)) eroded the slowest. A similar trend for in vitro drug release and in vivo pharmacokinetics after IM injection in rats was observed. In vivo tmax of the poloxamer in situ forming gels was about 6 h and a short-term sustained drug release was observed in vivo in rats up to 24 h after dosing, similar to an IM administered solution of bedaquiline fumarate salt in PEG400/water. In conclusion, IM administration of the evaluated poloxamer in situ forming gels may be useful for drugs that require a short-term sustained release, but is not able to extend drug release rates up to weeks or months. 	Sandy Van Hemelrycka,⁎ , Jonatan Dewulfb , Harm Niekusc , Marjolein van Heerdend , Benno Ingelsee , René Holmf,g , Erik Mannaerta , Peter Langguthh
3	2018	Renewable poly(d-decalactone) based block copolymer micelles as drug delivery vehicle: in vitro and in vivo evaluation	abstract Polymers from natural resources are attracting much attention in various fields including drug delivery as green alternatives to fossil fuel based polymers. In this quest, novel block copolymers based on renewable poly(d-decalactone) (PDL) were evaluated for their drug delivery capabilities and compared with a fossil fuel based polymer i.e. methoxy-poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(e-caprolactone) (mPEG-b-PCL). Using curcumin as a hydrophobic drug model, micelles of PDL block copolymers with different orientation i.e. AB (mPEG-b-PDL), ABA (PDL-b-PEG-b-PDL), ABC (mPEG-b-PDL-b-poly(pentadecalactone) and (mPEG-b-PCL) were prepared by nanoprecipitation method. The size, drug loading and curcumin stability studies results indicated that mPEG-b-PDL micelles was comparable to its counterpart mPEG-b-PCL micelles towards improved delivery of curcumin. Therefore, mixed micelles using these two copolymers were also evaluated to see any change in size, loading and drug release. Drug release studies proposed that sustained release can be obtained using poly(pentadecalactone) as crystalline core whereas rapid release can be achieved using amorphous PDL core. Further, mPEG-b-PDL micelles were found to be non-haemolytic, up to the concentration of 40 mg/mL. In vivo toxicity studies on rats advised low-toxic behaviour of these micelles up to 400 mg/kg dose, as evident by histopathological and biochemical analysis. In summary, it is anticipated that mPEG-b-PDL block copolymer micelles could serve as a renewable alternative for mPEG-b-PCL copolymers in drug delivery applications. 1. Introduction In drug delivery applications, amphiphilic block copolymers are used extensively owing their inherent self-assembly behaviour into diverse nanostructures, such as micelles (Gaucher et al., 2005; Lu and Park, 2013). The term ‘‘micelles” defines the aggregation of amphiphilic molecule in core-shell structure, above their critical micelle concentrations (CMC) when dispersed in solvent usually water (Azum et al., 2017b; Kumar and Rub, 2016) (Fig. 1). The CMC is defined as the concentration of amphiphilic molecules in solvent, above which they start forming micelles (Azum et al., 2017a). Amphiphilic block copolymers with poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG) as hydrophilic block such as PEG-b-poly (lactic acid) (PEG-b-PLA), PEG-b-poly(caprolactone) (PEG-b-PCL), PEG-b-poly(aspartic acid) (PEG-b-PA) etc., have been extensively studied as drug delivery carriers. The hydrophobic block in such copolymers can be chosen based on the required application; however, those derived from renewable resources have gained utmost interest, because of their environment friendly nature, abundant availability and in most cases biocompatibility, biodegradability and non-toxicity (Zhang et al., 2017). Additionally, polymers from renewable resources fitting in the concept of ‘‘acting responsibly to meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs” (Vilela et al., 2014). Therefore, several renewable feedstocks from either plant or animal sources have been discovered, to synthesize polymers with tunable properties. Micellar formulations have already shown their presence in the market. Genexol PM (micelles of PEG-b-PLA) have been approved in South Korea for the treatment of breast cancer (Weissig et al., 2014) whereas NC 6004 (micelles of PEG-b-PAA) and NK 911, NK10 (micelles of PEG-b-PA) are in clinical trials (Weissig and Guzman-Villanueva, 2015). Genexol PM, though, have been fabricated using renewable polymer (PLA), but is expensive and has certain limitations. A few reports suggested that the drug loading achieved using PLA block polymer or their copolymers are usually low owing to its lower hydrophobicity. Therefore, more hydrophobic derivatives of lactide have been prepared (Trimaille et al., 2004, 2006; Yin and Baker, 1999); however, the synthesis procedure appears to be tedious and expensive. Moreover, in PLA-derived drug delivery materials, the production of excessive acid from PLA degradation can cause deleterious effects on loaded acidsensitive drugs, thus limits its application (Kang and Schwendeman, 2002; Meyer et al., 2012). Therefore, the quest for new polymers from renewable resources continues, which could serve as a alternative for such existing polymers. Recently, we have reported the synthesis of amphiphilic block copolymers derived from an economical and renewable monomer i.e. d-decalactone (Bansal et al., 2015). Studies performed on the poly(d-decalactone) (PDL) derived copolymers suggested that they have remarkable potential to act as a drug delivery carrier. Therefore, in the present study, we have compared the drug delivery capability of micelles of PDL with non-renewable PCL block copolymer using curcumin as a model drug. Micelles of block copolymers were fabricated using a revised nano-precipitation method (Schubert et al., 2011) as this offers advantages over the other methods. PCL block copolymer have been investigated earlier for the improved delivery of curcumin and therefore, chosen here for a comparative study. It has been demonstrated that mixed micelles prepared from two or more different block copolymers were capable to enhance the formulation stability and drug loading efficiency compared to the micelles prepared from single block copolymer (Attia et al., 2011). Therefore, mixed micelle formulation using mPEG-b-PDL and mPEG-b-PCL copolymer has been also fabricated to study the effect on curcumin loading content and release pattern. Another important parameter, which needs to be addressed for polymers in drug delivery, is toxicity (Ghanghoria et al., 2018). Hence, an ex vivo haemolysis study was conducted to measure haemocompatibility of mPEG-b-PDL polymers. Further, micelles were also tested on rats for in vivo sub-chronic toxicity. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Materials Curcumin (99.5%), triton X-100 (BioXtra), haematoxylin and eosin solution have been purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. Previously synthesised block copolymers of PDL and PCL have been used in all studies (Bansal et al., 2015) (Scheme 1). All the solvents used were purchased from Fischer Scientific UK. 2.2. Methods 2.2.1. Micelles preparation from PDL and PCL block copolymers Curcumin loaded micelles of block copolymers were prepared by a single-step nano-precipitation method with minor modifications (Gou et al., 2011). Briefly, curcumin (2 mg) was dissolved along with the polymer (50 mg) in acetone (5 mL) and added drop wise into Milli-Q water (10 mL) under stirring (1000 rpm). The solution was then stirred for 3 h at room temperature and left overnight (open vial) to ensure the complete removal of acetone. Curcumin is light sensitive and hence the whole process was performed in the dark . Empty micelles were prepared using same procedure without curcumin. Mixed micelles of mPEG-b-PDL and mPEG-b-PCL were fabricated by physical mixing (Bae et al., 2007) of both copolymer (25 mg each) in acetone (5 mL) and the method described above was employed to obtain curcumin-loaded mixed micelles. Curcumin loaded micelles were purified by passing through PD10 Desalting Column (Sephadex G-25 Medium, GE Healthcare Life Sciences). In this procedure, materials of <5 K molecular weight were retained giving the sample (eluent) free from any unencapsulated drug. Separately, the crude micellar solution was also purified by filtration using a membrane syringe filter (pore size: 220 nm) (Millex-LG, Millipore Co., USA) to determine the efficiency of individual purification method. A part of the micellar solution was freeze dried for the determination of drug content. 2.2.2. Characterisation of micelles for size, zeta potential and surface morphology For the size and polydispersity index measurements, micelle samples (50 mg/mL) in Milli-Q water were analysed on a Malvern NanoZS instrument. Surface zeta potential was measured from same instrument in HEPES 10 mM buffer (pH-7.4). TEM images were taken to confirm the size and to determine the surface morphology. Samples were imaged on TEM grids without staining. All the measurements were performed on three different batches and the mean values were reported. 2.2.3. Curcumin content, stability and in vitro release behaviour from micelles Drug Content (DC) and Encapsulation Efficiency (EE) of curcumin in micelles were determined by dissolving the known amount of freeze dried samples of micelles in acetone followed by quantification of the drug concentration using fluorescence spectroscopy (Varian) after appropriate dilutions. For analysis, samples were excited at a fixed wavelength (kex = 420 nm) and spectra were recorded in a range of 450–600 nm (Fig. 2) (Leung and Kee, 2009). The excitation and emission slit widths were selected at 5 nm and selected emission intensity was 524 nm. Amount of curcumin present in sample was than calculated using curcumin standard calibration curve prepared in acetone. All stud The ability of mPEG-b-PDL micelles to protect the curcumin from degradation at physiological pH was tested using a reported method (Ma et al., 2008). Freeze dried micelles of mPEG-b-PDL and mPEG-bPCL containing curcumin equivalent to 100 mg, were redispersed in 2 mL of PBS (pH 7.4) and incubated at 37 C. For the preparation of control samples, free curcumin (100 mg) was dissolved in 2 mL of phosphate buffer saline (PBS) using methanol as co-solvent and incubated at 37 C in a closed container. At predetermined time intervals, 100 mL of the sample was withdrawn and diluted with acetone up to 1 mL. The amount of remaining curcumin was then determined using a fluorescence spectrophotometer. The release profile of curcumin from micelles was determined by a dialysis m ethod (Ma et al., 2008). Briefly, a calculated quantity of curcumin-loaded freeze dried micelles equivalent to 350 mg of curcumin was dissolved in PBS (2 mL) (pH-7.4). The micellar solution in PBS was then placed in dialysis tubing (Float-A-Lyzer) having the molecular weight cut off (mwco) of 3.5–5 kDa. The samples were dialysed against 500 mL of PBS (pH 7.4) at 37 C. The release media was replaced with fresh PBS in every 24 h. The volume of solution in the dialysis tubing was measured at appropriate time intervals (~6 h), and restored to the original with PBS, if necessary. Samples (100 mL) were withdrawn directly from the dialysis tubing at predetermined time intervals and the volume of solution in the dialysis tubing was restored with fresh solvent. Samples were analysed after diluting with acetone using a fluorescence spectrophotometer to calculate the amount of curcumin remaining in the micelles. 2.2.4. Toxicity studies of novel poly(decalactone) micelles Blank micelles solution (mPEG-b-PDL) of different concentration were used in all toxicity studies. 2.2.4.1. Ex vivo haemolytic study. The haemolytic study was performed using reported procedure with slight modifications (Evans et al., 2013). Briefly, human blood (5 mL) was drawn from an anonymous donor directly into Na2-EDTA-coated tube to prevent coagulation. Collected blood was than centrifuge at 500g for 5 min to separate plasma and red blood cells (RBCs), and plasma (yellowish, upper layer) was discarded. Separated RBCs was than washed twice with 150 mM NaCl solution followed by one wash with phosphate buffer saline (PBS, pH – 7.4). RBCs were than diluted up to 5 times with PBS (pH – 7.4) to make stock suspension. Micelles (50 mg/mL) prepared in PBS were further diluted to make 25, 12.5, 1.25 and 0.625 mg/mL concentration with PBS. For haemolysis assay, 800 ll of each dilution of micelles (i.e. 50, 25, 12.5, 1.25 and 0.625 mg/mL) was make up to 1 mL by adding 200 ll RBCs stock suspension. Therefore, the stocks of 50, 25, 12.5, 1.25 and 0.625 mg/mL, resulting in final test concentrations of 40, 20, 10, 1 and 0.5 mg/mL of micelles, respectively. Positive control tubes was prepared by adding 800 ll of 1.25% solution of triton X-100 in 200 ll RBCs whereas for negative control tubes, 800 ll of PBS was added. Tubes were prepared in two batches (n = 3) and incubated at 37 C for 1 h and 24 h separately with occasional shaking. After incubation, tubes were centrifuge for 5 min at 500g to pellet undamaged RBCs. The supernatant from each tube was than analysed on UV–Vis spectroscopy to measure the absorbance of released haemoglobin (kmax – 542 nm). The percentage haemolysis was calculated using formula below: % Haemolysis ¼ Abs of sample  Abs of negative control Abs of positive control  Abs of negative control 2.2.4.2. In vivo toxicity study. Six-to-seven weeks old Albino rats were divided in four groups (n = 6) in which one is control group (group-A) while rest were treated groups (group-B, C, D). The study protocol was duly approved by Institutional Animal Ethical Committee (IAEC) and experiments were performed according to the guidelines of ‘‘Committee for the Purpose of Control and Supervision of Experiments on Animals” (CPCSEA), India (approval number – GLAIPR/CPCSEA/IAEC/2016/PhD/R2). Animals were housed at 23 ± 2 C with a 12 h day/night cycle, food and water was supplied everyday ad libitum. Three different concentrations of blank micelles , i.e. 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg were administered intra-peritoneally (IP) to group ‘‘B”, ‘‘C” and ‘‘D” respectively while Milli-Q water was injected to group ‘‘A” animals for seven days. Body weight of animals was measured for comparison purpose before injecting micellar solution/Milli-Q water on each day to determine preliminary toxicity. A loss of body weight by 2 g in three or more rats in a group would be considered as the origination of toxicity (Burt et al., 1999). (a) Heamatological-Biochemical Analysis On 8th day, blood samples from each group were collected and divided in two parts for pathological analysis. Pathological test has been carried out to determine the serum level of aspartate transaminase (AST or SGOT), alanine transaminase (ALT or SGPT), urea, bilirubin and creatinine. Further, evaluation of heamatological parameters consisting haemoglobin, white blood cells, neutrophils, lymphocytes, eosinophils, haematocrit, monocytes, basophils, red blood cell count, platelets have been done. (b) Histo-Pathological Analysis In this analysis, liver, heart, spleen, lungs and kidneys of the animals were removed surgically, washed and transferred in 10% neutral buffered formalin and left for 48 h at room temperature. Tissue sections were then prepared after dehydration and embedding the samples in paraffin. The sections were then stain with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and processed for histo-pathological examination under optical microscope fitted with camera. The brief procedure of dehydration and embedding is as follow: Dehydration of tissue pieces: Tissues pieces were removed from 10% formalin solution and place in absolute alcohol for dehydration. Three changes were given in absolute alcohol each for 15 min. Preparation of tissues for embedding: After three changes in absolute alcohol, pieces were transferred in xylene. Three changes of xylene were given each for 20 min. Paraffin infiltration and embedding: The paraffin wax was melted by heating up to 62 ± 2 C and kept in molten state in pan. The tissues were then transferred directly in molten wax in the first infiltration pan for 45 min at 62 ± 2 C in an oven. After the first embedding, tissue pieces were removed and placed in second infiltration pan having molten wax and kept at controlled temperature for 45 min. Block preparation: Molten wax was poured in the mould up to 4/5th of total height. The tissues were then removed from the infiltration, placed gently to the mould, and topped up with wax. It was allowed to stand at room temperature till solidified. The wax block was than separated, cut, and trimmed to remove excess wax. Microtomy: The block was then cut into ribbon like sections with the help of microtome. The ribbon sections were transferred to a slide on which a fixative (Egg albumin solution) had been applied. Staining of slide: The section on slide was de-waxed with xylol. Staining was done using haematoxylin and eosin (H&E). The sections were mounted with Canada balsam on the slides carefully with cover slip. 2.2.5. Statistical analysis Data were represented as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Statistical analysis was conducted by one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test using P < .05 as a statistical significance threshold. 3. Results 3.1. Preparation and characterisation of curcumin loaded micelles Micelles of poly(decalactone) and poly(caprolactone) block copolymers were prepared by nano-precipitation method, in which self-assembly of copolymers generates core-shell structures in aqueous solvent. Curcumin loading experiments was performed in Milli-Q water due to the poor stability of curcumin in alkaline conditions (Naksuriya et al., 2014). Curcumin was expected to encapsulate in the polymeric micelle cores via hydrophobic interactions during the process of self-assembly. Any non-encapsulated curcumin was separated from the micelles by passing through a PD10 desalting (Sephadex) column or by filtration using syringe filter (0.22 m). However, loss of curcumin loaded micelles was observed with Sephadex column purification method and therefore, subsequent purifications of micelles was performed by filtration only, which also provide sterility to the formulations. Post purification, cloudy appearance of PDL-bPEG-b-PDL micelles solution advised the presence of clusters in this formulation (Fig. 3). The estimated size of micelles by DLS and TEM are presented in Table 1, Fig. 4. The Z-average size observed for mPEG-b-PCL and mPEG-b-PDL micelles was almost identical while mPEG-b-PDL-b-PPDL and PDL-b-PEG-b-PDL copolymers produces micelles of larger size ples suggested that the micelles are of roughly spherical in shape and majority of micelles fall in the size range of 20–40 nm (Fig. 4). Presence of clusters has been observed in PDL-b-PEG-bPDL copolymer micelles as evident by size distribution curve acquired from DLS and by TEM image. Micelles obtained from mPEG-b-PDL-b-PPDL copolymers are slightly larger compared to the micelles generated from rest of the block copolymers. A slight surge in the Z-average sizes of the micelles were observed after curcumin loading when compared to the empty micelles except with PDL-b-PEG-b-PDL (Table 1). The increase in the size of the micelles after curcumin loading has also been reported previously (Gou et al., 2011; Ma et al., 2008; Shao et al., 2011). The sizes observed for mixed micelles by DLS were almost identical to the sizes observed for mPEG-b-PDL and mPEG-b-PCL micelles (not shown). The surface charge observed for curcumin loaded micelles showed non-significant difference compared to blank micelles (Table 1). The curcumin content and encapsulation efficiency observed in amphiphilic block copolymers micelles are shown in Fig. 5. The micelles fabricated from mPEG-b-PCL copolymer demonstrated the drug content of 4.0 ± 0.4 wt%, with an encapsulation efficiency of 80.3 ± 8.9%. However, content found for mPEG-b-PDL micelles was 3.3 ± 0.5 wt%. Curcumin content in PDL-b-PEG-b-PDL micelles was found to be least (2.1 ± 0.1 wt%) when compared with other studied polymeric micelles. The micelles prepared from mPEG-bPDL-b-PPDL copolymer showed a drug content of 2.6 ± 0.1 wt%. Curcumin content observed in mixed micelles of mPEG-b-PDL and mPEG-b-PCL (1:1) was 3.6 ± 0.4 wt%, which lies between the curcumin content observed for individual copolymers. The loading percentages were further compared using one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s correction for multiple comparisons. Using P < .05 as a statistical significance threshold, only PDL-b-PEG-bPDL micelles loading content showed significant differences when compared to the other formulations. The rest formulations did not significantly differ in their drug content. Encapsulation efficiency followed the similar pattern as loading content except for mPEGb-PDL-b-PPDL micelles because of the loss of significant amount of loaded polymeric micelles during purification by filtration. 3.2. Curcumin stability study It has been reported that curcumin undergoes hydrolytic degradation at alkaline pH (Wang et al., 1997). Hence, evaluation of the degradation rate of encapsulated curcumin is an important evaluation parameter to assess the ability of micelles as protectant. mPEG-b-PDL copolymer micelles demonstrated better results compared to other PDL block copolymers in terms of size and loading, and therefore was selected for the curcumin stability study. The stabilities of free curcumin and curcumin loaded in micelles were tested for 10 h in phosphate buffer saline (PBS, pH – 7.4). After 2 h, free curcumin was degraded/ hydrolysed completely whereas only 3% of degradation was observed in encapsulated curcumin (Fig. 6). After 10 h, curcumin in PDL micelles showed 11% of degradation while PCL micelles were able to protect 91% of drug from degradation (9% of degradation). Thus, the ability of mPEG-b-PDL micelles to protect curcumin from degradation in PBS was found to be identical with their counterpart mPEG-b-PCL micelles. 3.3. In vitro release behaviour of curcumin from block copolymers micelles A controlled release pattern from a polymeric system is desirable to justify its potential as a drug delivery carrier (Uhrich et al., 1999). Curcumin showed rapid degradation in the chosen release medium i.e. PBS and therefore samples were collected directly from the dialysis tube to avoid any error due to its degradation (Ma et al., 2008). The release patterns of curcumin from the different amphiphilic block copolymers micelles are presented in Fig. 7. Initial burst release of curcumin was observed in all samples where 43% release was observed with mPEG-b-PDL-b-PPDL micelles and 19% release was noticed with mPEG-b-PCL micelles in first 9 h. After 175 h, more than 95% of curcumin was released from mPEG-b-PDL, mPEG-b-PCL and mPEG-b-PDL + mPEG-b-PCL mixed micelles however, mPEG-b-PDL-b-PPDL micelles showed 83% release. Micelles of PDL-b-PEG-b-PDL copolymer displayed rapid release (96% after 125 h) whereas, slowest release pattern was observed with mPEG-b-PDL-b-PPDL micelles (76% after 125 h). In conclusion, faster release was observed with micelles containing PDL core compared to PCL or PPDL core. The rapid release from the mPEG-b-PDL could be beneficial over those drug delivery carriers where incomplete release of drug(s) was observed (Shaikh et al., 2009). 3.4. Toxicity studies of block copolymers micelles of poly(decalactone) Since the performance of mPEG-b-PDL copolymer micelles is almost identical to mPEG-b-PCL micelles, this copolymer micelles have been further investigated for it’s toxicity. Heamolytic study was performed to evaluate the extent of RBCs lysis potentially caused by mPEG-b-PDL copolymer micelles upon injection (Amin and Dannenfelser, 2006). The mPEG-b-PDL micelles were tested for their heamolysis capacity up to the concentration of 40 mg/ mL in static condition. Visual inspection of incubated tubes after centrifugation provided a preliminary idea of RBCs lysis. As shown in Fig. 8, absence of red color observed in supernatant (except from positive control where all cells are deliberately lysed using surfactant) after 1 h of incubation (Fig. 8A-3) proposed minimum or negligible heamolysis whereas significant amount of lysis was observed after 24 h of incubation in the sample containing 40 mg/mL micelles (Fig. 8B-3). The RBCs image also confirmed the presence of few ruptured cells in this sample (Fig. 8-D). Quantitative estimation by UV–Vis suggested 0.49 ± 0.01, 0.57 ± 0.15, 2.85 ± 0.46, 5.46 ± 0.47, 7.58 ± 0.94 percentage heamolysis after 1 h whereas 1.08 ± 0.03, 2.61 ± 0.72, 7.02 ± 1.33, 22.81 ± 1.25, 39.90 ± 2.14 percentage heamolysis was observed after 24 h for 0.5, 1.0, 10, 20 and 40 mg/mL concentration micelles respectively. The results suggested that micelles up to 40 mg/mL as drug delivery vehicle are less-heamolytic after 1 h incubation whereas, concentration and time dependent heamolysis was observed after 24 h incubation (Fig. 9). Further, in vivo toxicity of mPEG-b-PDL micelles have been assessed by comparing the haematological and biochemical parameters of untreated (control) and treated rats. Additionally, histopathological changes, if any, in major organs were also assessed to determine the harmful effect caused by micelles. Animals have treated with mPEG-b-PDL micellar solution for six days up to the concentration of 400 mg/kg. Multiple IP doses of micelles up to 400 mg/kg concentration in rats did not produce any mortality during the study duration. Further, no significant reduction in weight (i.e. 2 g) has been observed in rats post injections. Haematology study results reveals no statistically significant changes in blood parameters in treated group animals compared to control group animals. The results obtained from the blood samples collected from group ‘‘D” animals (400 mg/kg dose) are presented in Figs. 10 and 11. In addition, values of biochemical parameters of liver and kidneys functions suggested that micellar solution did not elicit any toxic effect up to the tested concentration in rats (Fig. 11). Furthermore, to examine the toxic effect of micelles on specific organs, histopathological changes in heart, lung, liver, kidney and spleen were observed by light microscope. The tissue images of treated organs did not showed any abnormalities/inflammation compared to the control organs tissue images (Fig. 12). Additionally, comprehensive investigation of pictures of treated liver tissues revealed absence of activated Kupffer cells, sinusoidal dilatation and cytoplasmic vacuolation, which advised absence of any toxic reaction caused by micelles. Similarly, non-existence of granular cast, cellular cast and protein cast in kidney tissue images suggesting non-toxic nature of micelles up to the tested concentration (Siti et al., 2014). Likewise, no apparent histopathologic changes such as cells necrosis, inflammation were observed in images of heart, lung and spleen of treated group compared to control group (El-Refaiy and Eissa, 2013; Al-Forkan et al., 2016). 4. Discussion In the presented study, novel block copolymers of PDL has been investigated for the improved delivery of curcumin and the results were compared with PCL block copolymer. Poly(decalactone) block copolymers with different orientation like AB (mPEG-b-PDL), ABA (PDL-b-PEG-b-PDL) and ABC (mPEG-b-PDL-b-PPDL) type have been evaluated at one platform to determine the effect of polymer structure on particle size, drug loading and release. The micelles were prepared by nanoprecipitation method due the disadvantages associated with other commonly used techniques. For instance, with the solvent evaporation (film method) method, incomplete reconstitution of the polymeric film was observed in aqueous solvent resulting in polymer loss and consequently decreases the micelles efficiency (Aliabadi and Lavasanifar, 2006). Emulsion method for micelle preparation was not preferred due to the requirement of toxic solvents such as dichloromethane and chloroform (Aliabadi and Lavasanifar, 2006; Naksuriya et al., 2014). In the dialysis method, use of organic solvent in dialysis bag is required. However, solvents other than DMSO is not recommended for use with the regenerated cellulose membrane and none of the solvents (such as DMF, DMSO) is recommended with the cellulose membrane (Kim et al., 1998; Zhang et al., 2007) as this could damage the membrane causing undesired loss of micelles in the release medium. Additionally, good solubility of copolymer and drug is desirable in the above mentioned solvent. Further, large-scale preparation of micelles using dialysis method seems not feasible. The un-encapsulated drug was removed in subsequent purification steps to avoid false results. It was found that the purification by filtration was better than PD10 column method in this study. Incomplete recovery of drug-loaded micelles was observed with column purification and thus avoided to achieve the high yield. The micelles produced by nano-precipitation using mPEG-b-PDL and mPEG-b-PCL copolymers are of comparable size. This could be due to the similar hydrophobic to hydrophilic ratio and same orientation (AB type, di-block) of both copolymer. However, as expected, triblock copolymers produced larger size micelles. ABA type block copolymer showed cluster formation whereas ABC copolymer produced larger size micelles due to its poor solubility in acetone (Bansal et al., 2015). Therefore, mPEG-b-PDL-b-PPDL copolymer is not a good candidate to fabricate micelles using nanoprecipitation method with acetone as a solvent. The insignificant change in zeta potential of micelles after curcumin loading suggested that the curcumin was located in the micellar core, shielded by the PEG corona. Curcumin loading in PDL block copolymers was found to be less compared with PCL block copolymer. It has been reported that the ability of a hydrophobic core to encapsulate a drug is mainly depends upon its compatibility with the drug molecule (Letchford et al., 2008; Lu and Park, 2013). Therefore, it was assumed that curcumin could be less compatible with PDL polymer and thus micelles with PDL core forming block demonstrated low loading compared to micelles with PCL core. However, low loading with PDL micelles may not be observe with all drugs since, recent studies suggested that amorphous core could produce formulations with high drug payload (Gou et al., 2015; Kakde et al., 2016). Curcumin content observed with mPEG-b-PCL micelles in this study was significantly less when compared with previously reported results. The variation in the results might have been due to the different parameters used for loading in the individual studies. Encapsulation procedure, drug to polymer ratio, molecular weight of polymer, solvent used etc. could significantly influence the loading content (Feng et al., 2012; Gong et al., 2013; Gou et al., 2015; Ma et al., 2008; Mohanty et al., 2010) and hence these parameters can be tailored to achieve the maximum drug loading. The objective in current study was to compare the loading results obtained from novel and well established block copolymers using identical parameters. Thus, the optimisation of the formulation parameters was not performed in this work but could be considered in future studies. Curcumin loading observed with the mixed micelles suggested that mixing of the novel renewable copolymer (mPEG-b-PDL) with a copolymer synthesised from non-renewable feedstock (such as mPEG-b-PCL) could provide similar drug loading when compared to the results obtained from single block copolymer. Thus, the mixed micelle approach might be useful to reduce the amount of non-renewable copolymer(s) in final formulation. In curcumin stability study, the degradation rate of curcumin encapsulated in mPEG-b-PDL micelles was found to be slower compared to the free drug. This result suggests that the curcumin was located inside the highly hydrophobic PDL core. Due to this reason, the direct contact of curcumin with PBS was hampered and thus; the degradation rate was reduced. The mPEG-b-PDL micelle’s ability to protect the degradation of curcumin was also found to be similar to the mPEG-b-PCL micelles. In the release experiment, burst release was observed from all micelle formulations, which could be attributed to the presence of drug on the exterior part (surface) of the hydrophobic block. The initial burst release of curcumin from polymeric micelles was also reported earlier in which 30–40% of drug was released within 10 h (Bisht et al., 2007; Shao et al., 2011; Zhao et al., Control Treated Liver Kidney Heart Lung Spleen Fig. 12. Histological evaluation of major organs of the rat treated with mPEG-b-PDL micelles (400 mg/kg, IP). No abnormalities/inflammation were observed in the tissue images compared to control group. Images were taken at 10X magnification with haematoxylin and eosin staining. 366 K.K. Bansal et al. / Saudi Pharmaceutical Journal 26 (2018) 358–368 2012). On the basis of the release results, it can be proposed that the mechanism responsible for the release of curcumin from the studied micelles is mainly diffusion. It has been reported that polymers with low Tm, Tg value and low crystallinity release their loaded content rapidly (Karavelidis et al., 2010; Papadimitriou and Bikiaris, 2009) and therefore, the drug permeated faster from the amorphous PDL core compared to semicrystalline (PCL) or crystalline (PPDL) core polymeric micelles (Teng et al., 1998). A similar release pattern has been reported with PLGA nano carriers where increase in the composition of D, L-PLA (amorphous polymer) increased the release rate of loaded drug (Jain, 2000; Nasongkla et al., 2006). Delayed release observed from mPEG-b-PDL-b-PPDL micelles was most likely due to the restricted diffusion of drug from the more crystalline poly(pentadecalactone) core (Liu et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2009). Similar results were reported earlier with poly(propylene succinate-co-caprolactone) copolymer nanoparticles where mixing of crystalline polymer with amorphous polymer decreased the release rate compared to the release observed from the amorphous polymer alone (Papadimitriou and Bikiaris, 2009). The release rate observed for mPEG-b-PCL micelles in this study was more sustained than previously reported release pattern for mPEG-b-PCL micelles of similar molecular weight (Ma et al., 2008). This difference in release pattern can be attributed to the concentration of curcumin, sample withdrawal method and release media used for the study. It was reported that when higher drug concentration was used for the release study, a more sustained release pattern was observed (Layre et al., 2006; Soo et al., 2002). Additionally, the release pattern could be different in the different release media, based on the partition coefficient of the drug at different pH. In the previous report, we have demonstrated the comparable toxicity profile of mPEG-b-PDL micelles with mPEG-b-PCL micelles in vitro (Bansal et al., 2015). Therefore, in the current study, we further evaluated mPEG-b-PDL micelles to assess their toxicity ex vivo and in vivo. Heamolysis assay results suggested that the tested concentration of mPEG-b-PDL micelles are non-heamolytic after 1 h incubation (heamolysis 10%). However, after 24 h incubation, concentration above 10 mg/mL was appeared to be heamolytic (Amin and Dannenfelser, 2006). Although, in dynamic condition i.e. inside the human body, the concentration of mPEG-b-PDL micelles interacting with RBCs would probably not reach above 10 mg/mL due to the dilution with approximately 5 l of blood. Therefore, it can be proposed that the drug delivery via injectable route using this novel carrier system could be harmless. The preliminary in vivo toxicity studies was performed via IP route based on previous published literature and the limitations of the IV route in repeated-dose administration (Binkhathlan et al., 2017; Bulcão et al., 2013; Kim et al., 2003). The results suggested that IP dose of mPEG-b-PDL micelles up to the concentration of 400 mg/kg was well tolerated by tested animals without producing any noticeable adverse effects. These initial toxicity results on mPEGb-PDL micelles have paved the way for future investigations in generation of broader toxicity profile for human use. 5. Conclusion The block copolymer micelles of renewable poly(decalactone) with different orientation was evaluated for their drug delivery capability and results were compared with its non-renewable counterpart mPEG-b-PCL micelles. Based on the sizes observed for different copolymers, it can be assumed that polymer orientation (di or tri block) does make difference on micelles assembly. The drug loading results suggested that curcumin could be less compatible with PDL block compared to PCL block and thus showed a lesser amount of loading in triblock PDL micelles. Release experiment demonstrated that the drug released more quickly from amorphous PDL block compared to semicrystalline (PCL) or crystalline block (PPDL). However, based on the results, it could be proposed that the performance of novel mPEG-b-PDL micelles as a carrier was almost equivalent to the mPEG-b-PCL micelles. Further, ex vivo and in vivo toxicity results suggested the low toxicity profile of novel mPEG-b-PDL micelles. Thus, this study results suggested that mPEG-b-PDL copolymer could act as a renewable alternative for mPEG-b-PCL copolymer in drug delivery applications.	Kuldeep K.

4	2016	SW43-DOX ± loading onto drug-eluting bead, a potential new targeted drug delivery platform for systemic and locoregional cancer treatment e An in vitro evaluation	ABSTRACT Treatment of unresectable primary cancer and their distant metastases, with the liver representing one of the most frequent location, is still plagued by insufficient treatment success and poor survival rates. The Sigma-2 receptor is preferentially expressed on many tumor cells making it an appealing target for therapy. Thus, we developed a potential targeted drug conjugate consisting of the Sigma-2 receptor ligand SW43 and Doxorubicin (SW43-DOX) for systemic cancer therapy and for locoregional treatment of primary and secondary liver malignancies when loaded onto drug-eluting bead (DEB) which was compared in vitro to the treatment with Doxorubicin alone. SW43-DOX binds specifically to the Sigma-2 receptor expressed on hepatocellular (Hep G2, Hep 3B), pancreatic (Panc-1) and colorectal (HT-29) carcinoma cell lines with high affinity and subsequent early specific internalization. Free SW43-DOX showed superior concentration and time depended cancer toxicity than treatment with Doxorubicin alone. Action mechanisms analysis revealed an apoptotic cell death with increased caspase 3/7 activation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Only ROS scavenging with a-Tocopherol, but not the caspase inhibition (Z-VAD-FMK), partly reverted the effect. SW43-DOX could successfully be loaded onto DEB and showed prolonged eluting kinetics compared to Doxorubicin. SW43-DOX loaded DEB vs. Doxorubicin loaded DEB showed a significantly greater time dependent toxicity in all cell lines. In conclusion, the novel conjugate SW43- DOX  loading onto DEB is a promising drug delivery platform for targeted systemic and locoregional cancer therapy 1. Introduction Cancer is one of the leading public health problems worldwide. Recently published cancer statistics reported an overall 5-year survival rate increase in the United States from 49% in 1975 to 69% in 2011 for all cancer types. However, despite this survival incline, cancer is still the principal cause of death for much of the US population. Additionally, incidence and death rates have increased for several cancers including pancreatic and liver cancer, two of the deadliest cancer types whose prognosis has only improved minimal (Siegel et al., 2016). Despite the needed improvement of cancer detection at an early stage to ameliorate the outcome with e.g. curative tumor resection, there is an urgent demand for the development of novel and effective therapies of locally advanced and metastasized tumors. Besides primary liver cancer, the liver is also a frequent location for remote metastases of many tumor types including colorectal and pancreatic carcinoma occurring in the majority of the patients during the course of disease (De Groote and Prenen, 2015; Kotoyan et al., 2012; Li et al., 2015) which is currently still associated with a very poor survival prognosis unless resection or ablation as curative treatment modalities are feasible. Unfortunately, only the minority of patients are suitable candidates for curative treatment of primary and secondary liver tumors with the tumor liver burden considered as the major life-limiting cause in these patients (Bruix and Llovet, 2002; De Groote and Prenen, 2015; Forner et al., 2012; Jarzabek et al., 2011; Kotoyan et al., 2012). One of the current possible treatment approaches in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (Lewis and Holden, 2011; Nishikawa et al., 2014) and liver metastases (De Groote and Prenen, 2015; Jarzabek et al., 2011; Kotoyan et al., 2012) is the drug-eluting bead Transarterial Chemoembolization (DEBTACE). Briefly, DEB-TACE is a locoregional intra-arterial treatment approach where drug-eluting bead (DEB) loaded with a chemotherapeutic drug such as e.g. Doxorubicin or Irinotecan are released into the tumor’s vascular bed occluding the tumor vessels and release the drug over time reaching higher intratumoral drug concentrations than tolerated systemically (Hong et al., 2006; Nishikawa et al., 2014). Nonetheless, the overall response and survival rates in primary and secondary liver cancers are still lacking behind expectations (De Groote and Prenen, 2015; Jarzabek et al., 2011; Kotoyan et al., 2012; Lewis and Holden, 2011; Nishikawa et al., 2014). In this study, we therefore designed and tested a novel targeted drug potentially suitable for systemic treatment for a broad variety of cancers but also bears the potential for effective locoregional treatment of liver predominant malignancies when loaded onto DEB. The Sigma-2 receptor is present in a variety of tissues while an over-expression on proliferating cells and several rapidly growing tumor types including pancreatic cancer, colorectal carcinoma, breast cancer, lung cancer, and melanoma has been reported (Mach et al., 2013; van Waarde et al., 2015). To date, the physiological function in tumorous and nontumorous cells is poorly understood with no endogenous identified ligand to interact with the Sigma-2 receptor. However, available research data on Sigma-2 receptor agonists targeting the receptor suggests a potent antiproliferative and proapoptotic effect in cancer cells with only minimal to no harm in non-tumorous cells (Hornick et al., 2010; Huang et al., 2014). Moreover, Sigma-2 agonists sensitize for and act synergistically with chemotherapeutic drugs such as Doxorubicin (Crawford and Bowen, 2002), Gemcitabine (Hornick et al., 2010), Paclitaxel (Hashim et al., 2014; Hornick et al., 2010), internalize coupled substances actively and rapidly for increased intracellular accumulation (Makvandi et al., 2015; Spitzer et al., 2012; Zeng et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2012) without having demonstrated any sign of treatment resistance development (Mach et al., 2013). In summary, Sigma-2 receptor agonists coupled with a chemotherapeutic drug such as Doxorubicin may be a potential drug not only for the systemic but also for locoregional DEB-TACE cancer treatment with improved efficacy over the treatment with free and DEB loaded Doxorubicin respectively. To test our hypothesis, we chemically linked the previously described highly selective Sigma-2 receptor agonist SW43 (Hornick et al., 2010) with Doxorubicin (SW43-DOX), evaluated its biological activity, action mechanisms, and loaded it onto drug-eluting bead (DEB) suitable for DEB-TACE in vitro. 2. Material and methods 2.1. Synthesis The Sigma-2 agonist SW43 was synthesized as previously described (Chu et al., 2009). To prepare SW43 for the conjugation with Doxorubicin, we added a linker bearing azide and amino group followed by the coupling of an oxyamine group. Finally, Doxorubicin (A Chemteck Inc., Boston, MA, USA) was conjugated resulting in the desired compound SW43-DOX. The fluorescence dye cyanogen 3 (DBCO-Cy3) (Click Chemistry Tool, Scottsdale, AZ, USA) and the chelator DBCO-L-NETA with Lutetium177 (Lu177) were attached via copper free click chemistry. A more detailed synthesis description including documentation is provided in the supplementary material. 2.2. Cell lines and culturing The hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines Hep G2 and Hep 3B, the colorectal carcinoma cell line HT-29, and the pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line Panc-1 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA). Catalog number and passage number are provided in the supplementary material. Hep G2 and Hep 3B cell lines were cultured in Eagle’s Minimal Essential Medium (EMEM) þ2 mM L-Glutamine (Lonza, Walkersville, MD, USA), HT-29 in Mc Coy’s 5A þ 1.5 mM L-Glutamine, þ2.2 g/L Sodium Bicarbonate and Panc-1 in Dulbecco’s Modified Essential Medium (DMEM) þ 4.5 g/L D-Glucose, þ2 mM L-Glutamine, þ110 mg/L Sodium Pyruvate (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT, USA). All medias were supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT, USA) and Penicillin/Streptomycin; 100 mg/ml each (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA). Cells were cultured in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 C. For testing, cells were seeded in black walled, clear bottom 96 well plates (1  104 cells per well; cytotoxicity, caspase 3/7 activity, reactive oxygen species & TUNEL assay) or in 24 well plates for radioactive experiments (7.5  104 cells per well) one day prior to treatment and testing. 2.3. Fluorescence staining of the sigma-2 receptor Fluorescence staining of the Sigma-2 receptor in Hep G2, Hep 3B, HT-29 and Panc-1 cells was performed with SW43-DOXCy3. The fluorescence dye Cy3 was attached to the compound for imaging purposes due to an insufficient fluorescence signal of the Doxorubicin moiety at the tested concentration. Eight-well Lab-Tek II chamber slides (Nunc, Rochester, NY, USA) were coated with 0.1% Poly-L-Lysin (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). 1  104 cells per well were seeded 24 h prior to staining. Cells were washed with PBS twice, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) in PBS for 15 min and washed 3 before blocking with PBS containing 5% FCS, 0.3% Triton X-100 (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 1 h at room temperature. Staining (30 nM; SW43-DOX-Cy3)  receptor blocking (30 mM; SW43) was performed overnight in PBS þ1% BSA & 0.3% Triton X-100 (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) at 4 C. Cells were washed 3 with PBS prior and after nuclear DNA counterstaining with 30 nM DAPI (4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, dilactate; Life technologies, Eugene, OR, USA) for 5 min. Cells were mounted with ProLong Gold antifade reagent (Life technologies, Eugene, OR, USA). Fluorescence was visualized using the Zeiss Axio Observer Fluorescence microscope in conjunction with the ApoTome 2 imaging system (Carl Zeiss Microimaging GmbH, Jena, Germany). Fluorescence images of SW43-DOX-Cy3 were obtained with an emission/excitation wavelength of 538e562/570e640 nm and captured with the ApoTome Camera (Evolve Delta). Nuclear images were obtained with the DAPI filter set (excitation/emission: 335e383/ 420e470 nm). All images were obtained with a 40 magnification. For each cell line, the same fluorescence image parameters were used for SW43-DOX-Cy3  blocking with the same intensity scale settings for image processing (ZEN 2012 Microscope Software for Windows v1.1.2; Carl Zeiss Microimaging GmbH, Jena, Germany). 2.4. Saturation binding assay Saturation binding assay was performed with SW43-DOX-LNETA-Lu177 in whole cells to determine the concentration of half maximal binding to receptor (KD) and maximal binding capacity (Bmax) in mol/mg of protein in Hep G2, Hep 3B, HT-29 and Panc-1 cell lines. Cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated in Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) (Life technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with 0.1% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) (Sigma Aldrich Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO, USA) containing varying concentrations (1e300 nM) of SW43-DOX-L-NETA-Lu177 with and without Sigma-2 receptor pre blocking (SW43; 10 mM (1e75 nM) or 100 mM (100e300 nM), 15 min, RT) to determine the unspecific binding. After 3.5 h of incubation on ice, cells were washed twice with ice cold PBS (þ0.1% BSA) and harvested with 250 ml 0.5% Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) cell lysate solution (Sigma Aldrich Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO, USA). Radioactivity of binding and pre blocking group samples was measured in counts per minute (CPM) with the automated Packard Cobra II g-counter (Packard, Ramsey, MN, USA) and corrected for background activity (untreated cells) and whole cell protein. Total amount of SW43-DOX-LNETA-Lu177 in mol/mg of protein for each sample was quantified by normalization to the measured radioactivity (CPM) of 109 Mol SW43-DOX-L-NETA-Lu177. Counting efficacy for Lutetium177 was 8.5%. Protein quantification of each sample was determined using the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce, Grand Island, NY, USA). 2.5. Quantification of SW43-DOX internalization Internalization assay were performed to determine the internalization of the Lutetium177 labeled SW43-DOX (SW43-DOXL-NETA-Lu177) in Hep G2, Hep 3B, HT-29 and Panc-1 cell lines. Cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated with 75 nM of SW43-DOX-L-NETA-Lu177 in HBSS (þ0.1% BSA) with and without pre blocking (7.5 mM SW43, 15 min, RT) for 0.5, 1.0 & 2.0 h. Radioactive media was aspirated, wells were washed twice with PBS (þ0.1% BSA) and incubated with 20 mM sodium-acetate HBSS (pH 4.0) for 10 min at 37 C to capture the surface bound fraction. After removal of the surface bound fraction, cells were lysed with 0.5% SDS, radioactivity was measured and mol/mg protein were calculated as described in the saturation binding assay section (Section 2.4). 2.6. Cytotoxicity evaluation Cytotoxicity was quantified by Cell Titer-GLO Luminescence Cell Viability Assay (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) according to the manufacturers instructions. Briefly, the test quantifies the MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY 10 (2016) 1133 e1145 1135 metabolically active cells via cellular ATP quantification which correlates with the number of viable cells in a linear fashion. Tested substances were dissolved in DMSO and serially diluted in supplemented culture medium with a final DMSO concentration of less than 1%. For EC50 determination, defined as the treatment concentration which reduces the viability of treated cells to 50% within 24 h, was performed with concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 700 mM, dependent on cell line and tested substance. Pretreatment with the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK (25 mM) (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) or a-Tocopherol (200 mg/ml) (Acros Organics, Geel, Belgium) was started 1 h prior to treatment. For measurement, treatment medium was replaced with 100 ml fresh medium and 100 ml Glo reagent. Luminescence for each sample was measured after 10 min incubation with a multi-modal microplate reader (Synergy H4, BioTek Instruments Inc., Winooski, VT, USA) and relativized to untreated control group for comparison. For each experiment n  3 samples were tested. 2.7. Caspase 3/7 activity & reactive oxygen species quantification Caspase 3/7 activity was measured using the Caspase-Glo 3/7 Assay (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Briefly, the assay is based on a caspase 3/7 substrate resulting in a caspase-specific luminescence signal equivalent to the caspase 3/7 activity. ROS Quantification was performed using the ROS Glo Kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Here, the H2O2 substrate reacts with H2O2 generating a Luciferin precursor which is converted to light emitting Luciferin through a detection solution. The luminescence signal is proportional to the H2O2 concentration. Panc-1 cells were treated with 25e50 mM SW43-DOX for 6 h. Pan-caspase blocking (25 mM Z-VAD-FMK; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) or ROS elimination (200 mg/ml aTocopherol) was started 1 h prior to treatment. Caspase 3/7 substrate was added onto cells after treatment medium removal and luminescence was measured 30 min thereafter. H2O2 substrate was added together with SW43-DOX. Six hours later, the detection solution was added and luminescence was measured 20 min thereafter. Luminescence was quantified using the multi-mode microplate reader. Caspase 3/7 activity was normalized to parallel measured viability to account for occurred cell death by treatment and by untreated control group. Each sample was tested in at least triplicates. 2.8. Apoptosis detection via TUNEL assay Apoptosis induction was evaluated by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) Assay using the HT TiterTACS Assay Kit (Trevigen, Inc. Gaithersburg, MD, USA). Briefly, the TUNEL assay is a detection method of DNA fragments resulting from apoptotic signaling cascades by labeling the terminal ends of nucleic acids. Panc-1 cells were treated with 25e50 mM SW43-DOX for 6 h and TUNEL Assay Kit was applied according to the manufacturers instructions. Results from the assay were normalized to parallel measured viability to account for occurred cell death by treatment and by untreated control group. Each sample was tested in at least triplicates. 2.9. Loading and eluting kinetics quantification Doxorubicin and SW43-DOX loading and eluting kinetics were tested with 100e300 mm DC Bead intended for Doxorubicin loading (DEBDOX) (Biocompatibles UK Ltd, Farnham, UK). One vial contains a total volume of 10 ml with 2 ml DC Bead. Allmentioned amounts (inml) of DC Bead refer to the original volume of DC Bead itself as provided by manufacturer without accounting for any volume changes occurring during experiments. Prior to loading, DC Bead were washed twice with H2O to remove the saline solution. Loading experiments were performed at room temperature and constant gentle agitation. Loaded fractions were quantified by sampling via absorption measurement at 480 nm in a microplate reader. Maximal loading capacity of SW43-DOX onto DC Bead: 1 ml H2O with 1.15 mg SW43-DOX added to 1/100 of a vial (20 ml) of DC Bead. Absorption of loading solution was measured before loading initiation and 24 h after start (n  3) to calculate the maximal loading capacity. Loading kinetics of SW43-DOX and Doxorubicin were tested with 2.5 mg, each dissolved in 5 ml H2O and added to 5/100 of a vial (100 ml) of DC Bead. Loaded fraction was quantified by measuring the absorption at several time points (n  3) and set into relation of blank wells in a linear fashion with the initial concentration after correcting for absorption. Eluting: Prior loaded DC Bead (100 ml; 2.5 mg SW43- DOX/Doxorubicin) were added to 20 ml DMEM (without phenol red; þ4.5 g/L D-Glucose) supplemented with Penicillin/Streptomycin (100 mg/ml each) and 10% FCS at 37 C and 10% CO2 atmosphere to obtain the target pH of w7.4 as eluting condition. The absorption at 480 nm was measured at several time points (n  3) and concentration/eluted fraction was quantified via a doxorubicin standard curve. Treatment of cells with loaded drug-eluting bead was performed with 200 ml of aforementioned eluting suspension without the agitation. Each well containedw1 ml of unloaded (control group) or loaded DEB. Toxicity assessment was performed with n ¼ 6e8 per time point. 2.10. Statistical analysis All data is represented as mean  standard error (SE) if not stated otherwise. Groups were compared using the 2-tailed Student t-test for 2 groups or the One-Way ANOVA including Bonferroni Post-Hoc test for three ormore groups. KD and Bmaxwere calculated using the “One site e Total and nonspecific binding” non-linear regression model. EC50 values were calculated by non-linear curve fitting of viability versus drug concentrations. Statistical differences between EC50 values for SW43-DOX versus Doxorubicin in different cell lines were determined using the Extra sum-of-squares F test. All calculations were performed with PRISM 6 (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA). p-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. 3. Results 3.1. SW43-DOX binds to and internalizes into cancer cells specifically One of our major goals of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of the Sigma-2 receptor ligand SW43 (Hashim et al., 2014; 1136 MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY 10 (2016) 1133 e1145 Hornick et al., 2010) as a carrier for the specific delivery of a chemotherapeutic drug into tumor cells via the Sigma-2 receptor. As our test compound, we linked SW43 with Doxorubicin resulting in the compound SW43-DOX (Figure 1A). However, when two unrelated molecules are linked, the question arises if this leads to alterations of the receptor ligand binding site resulting in a lack or insufficient binding affinity to the target receptor. To address this concern, the binding of fluorescence labeled SW43-DOX was tested for the known Sigma-2 receptor expressing cell line Panc-1 as a positive control (Hornick et al., 2010; Kashiwagi et al., 2007) as well as in Hep G2, Hep 3B and HT-29 cells. Sigma-2 receptor staining was successful in all cell lines and was faint to diminished when the receptor was blocked by co-incubation with a high dose of unlabeled SW43 (Figure 1B) indicating the presence of the Sigma-2 receptor in these cell lines and the specific binding of SW43-DOX to this receptor. To further verify the Sigma-2 receptor presence, and to semi-quantify the receptor expression level on the cell surface, a saturation binding assay was performed. Here, Panc-1 cells demonstrated the highest specific cell surface binding capacity (Bmax) followed by HT29, Hep 3B and Hep G2 cells (Figure 1C). Furthermore, the affinity of SW43-DOX to the Sigma-2 receptor has proven high with relatively low dissociation constants (KD) ranging from 33.76 nM for HT-29 to 96.41 nM for Panc-1 cells (Table 1). Since Sigma-2 ligands have demonstrated rapid internalization into tumor cells once bound to the cell surface, thus bearing the potential for intracellular drug accumulation with increased effectiveness over untargeted drugs (Makvandi et al., 2015; Zeng et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2012), we evaluated the early specific internalization which was statistically significant at all tested time points (30, 60 & 120 min). The highest uptake was observed in Hep 3B cells within 30 min but no significant further increase was evident. In contrast, Hep G2 and Panc-1 3.2. SW43-DOX demonstrates a potent and superior cancer cell toxicity over doxorubicin To compare the pharmacological activity of SW43-DOX, a dose and time dependent toxicity assessment in cancer cell lines was performed in vitro and compared to the treatment efficacy of Doxorubicin alone. Cell lines were treated for 6, 24 and 48 h with 25 & 50 mM of Doxorubicin or SW43-DOX (Figure 3). Overall, SW43-DOX demonstrated a greater equimolar toxicity and a greater dose dependent toxicity over the treatment with Doxorubicin alone, especially at early time points (6 h) when Doxorubicin did not unfold its full potential yet. To illustrate SW43-DOX’s treatment potency, the treatment with 25 mM SW43-DOX exerted a significantly superior toxicity than the treatment with 50 mM Doxorubicin after 6 and 24 h in Hep G2, Hep 3B, Panc-1 and HT-29 cells. To further quantify the efficacy, EC50 concentrations for SW43-DOX and Doxorubicin were tested showing a 2.19-fold (Hep 3B) to more than 8-fold (HT-29) reduced EC50 concentration for the conjugate SW43- DOX over the treatment with Doxorubicin alone (Table 2). Interestingly, the difference in EC50 (Table 2) and killing potency after 48 h (Figure 3) for SW43-DOX vs. Doxorubicin was the greatest in HT-29 cells which demonstrated the lowest susceptibility towards Doxorubicin while SW43-DOX achieved a treatment efficacy comparable to the ones found in the other tested cell lines. This indicates the great potential for the treatment with SW43-DOX of cancer cells with less susceptibility to treatment with Doxorubicin. To further elucidate the effect of the individual components of the SW43-DOX compound, cells have been treated with 25 mM SW43, combined treatment with the unconjugated SW43 þ Doxorubicin, or Doxorubicin for 6/24 h (Figure 4). Although the compound showed superior toxicity over the treatment with Doxorubicin, a more diverse picture was presented when directly compared to the effect of SW43: Whereas at early time points (6 h) the effect was mostly comparable, the results after 24 h imply an additional treatment effect driven by the conjugation of Doxorubicin to SW43 in Hep G2 and Panc-1 cells. Thus, the effect after 6 h may be more driven by the SW43 moiety experiencing an additional treatment effect through the Doxorubicin moiety in Hep G2 and Panc-1 but not in HT-29 cells. This again may be seen as a sign of the relative Doxorubicin resistance of HT-29 compared to the other tested cell lines. The reasons for only minimal toxicity of the combined treatment of SW43 þ Doxorubicin is subject to further investigation. In Hep 3B cells, no relevant difference between SW43-DOX, SW43 and SW43 þ Doxorubicin was evident after 24 h. 3.3. SW43-DOX induces reactive oxygen species and activates the caspases 3/7 The production of reactive oxygen species and activation of the effector caspase 3/7 have both been shown to play a critical role in apoptosis induction when cancer cells are treated separately with either SW43 or Doxorubicin (El-Awady et al., 2015; Hornick et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2004). We therefore investigated if SW43-DOX also generates ROS, activates the caspases 3/7 and if their inhibition can at least partly revert the drug toxicity. Panc-1 cells were treated with 25 or 50 mM SW43- DOX for 6 h and assayed for ROS production and caspase 3/7 activity. As illustrated in Figure 5A, SW43-DOX induced a dose dependent ROS production to 1.72-fold (0.076; p < 0.01) for 25 mM and to 2.53-fold (0.31; p < 0.001) for 50 mM compared to untreated cells. In order to evaluate the relevance, cells were pretreated with a-Tocopherol (200 mg/ml) for 1 h which partly could increase viability from 42% to 62.7% (25 mM) and from 18.9% to 50.4% (50 mM); (p < 0.001) (Figure 5B). Next, SW43-DOX induced the caspase 3/7 activation to 2.16-fold (0.36; p < 0.05) for 25 mM and 3.33-fold (0.21) for 50 mM SW43-DOX (Figure 5D). In contrast to the findings with ROS, the preincubation with the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK (25 mM) for 1 h did not affect the viability after 24 h (Figure 5E). Moreover, the combined scavenging of produced ROS and caspase inhibition did not ameliorate viability to a greater extent than with the ROS scavenging alone indicating a ROS depended and a caspase independent mechanism of SW43-DOX (Figure 5C). Nonetheless, due to the positive TUNEL assay as sign of increased DNA breakage compared to the control group (Figure 5F) (p < 0.001), it can be concluded that mechanisms of action of SW43 are at least partly effected via apoptotic mechanisms. 3.4. SW43-DOX loads onto and elutes from drug-eluting bead For the treatment with drug-eluting bead, the loading and eluting properties are of great importance for the applicability evaluation. We assumed that loading of SW43-DOX onto DC Bead will be achieved via binding of the Doxorubicin moiety to the anionic sulfonate groups and will be eluted in the presence of the counterion sodium as illustrated in Figure 6A. The determined maximal drug loading capacity in water was calculated to be 53.5 mg (95% CI: 50.2e56.8 mg) within 24 h for 2 ml of 100e300 mm DC Bead (1 vial) when loaded with around twice the amount of the maximal loading capacity. The loading efficacy of 50 mg for 2 ml of DC Bead was determined to be 96.9% (95% CI: 96.37e97.28%) within 10 h showing a prolonged loading kinetics for the larger molecule SW43- DOX compared to the loading speed of 50 mg Doxorubicin reaching almost 100% loading efficacy within 60 min (Figure 6B). Since we hypothesized that SW43-DOX binds to the beads via the doxorubicin moiety, we tested for stability of the compound under loading condition showing a nonstatistical degradation of only 0.32% within 4 days of testing at 37 C. Eluting experiments were performed in DMEM cell longed compared to Doxorubicin achieving a maximal eluted fraction of around 16.48% compared to 20.74% for Doxorubicin of the originally loaded amount (Figure 6C). 3.5. SW43-DOX-DEB is more effective than Doxorubicin-DEB for cancer cell treatment Previous experiments have demonstrated a greater toxicity for SW43-DOX over the treatment with Doxorubicin alone. To finally test if SW43-DOX-DEB is a potentially suitable combination for the intra-arterial treatment of cancer cells with adequate pharmacological activity, the time dependent toxicity has been compared to Doxorubicin-DEB. Similar to previous toxicity experiments without prior loading onto DEB, SW43-DOX-DEB exerted a significantly greater toxicity than Doxorubicin-DEB in the treated Hep G2, Hep 3B, Panc-1 and HT-29 cells (Figure 7). The eluting kinetics as shown in Figure 6C are representative for the ones during treatment due to the same testing conditions for eluting kinetics and toxicity assessment. The estimated maximal effective treatment concentrations were 17.4 mM (95% CI: 16.54e18.25 mM) for SW43-DOX-DEB vs. 44.7 mM (95% CI: 42.50e46.44 mM) for Doxorubicin-DEB with around 80% reached within 2.5 h for SW43-DOX and 1 h for Doxorubicin respectively demonstrating a rapid wash in time for both drugs. Interestingly, after 6 h, the SW43-DOX-DEB treated cell lines Hep 3B and Panc1 experienced a viability reduction comparable to treatment with 50 mM of free SW43-DOX whereas the treatment with Doxorubicin-DEB did not exceed the toxicity of comparable free drug concentrations. This may be explained by the proximity of drug-eluting bead which directly elute SW43-DOX onto the cells specifically internalizing the compound which has been shown to be the greatest for these two cell lines (Figure 2). After 24 h of treatment, a tendency towards increased toxicity was observed for SW43-DOX-DEB over SW43-DOX (25 mM) and for Doxorubicin-DEB over Doxorubicin (25 & 50 mM) which might also be explained by the proximity of the eluting beads to the cell monolayer with neighboring higher drug concentrations instead of a homogenous distribution as measured for eluting kinetics. Since, similar to Forster et al (Forster et al., 2012), no toxic in vitro effect for unloaded drug-eluting beads on all cell lines could be observed (data not shown), the treatment effect of SW43-DOX-DEB and Doxorubicin-DEB is unlikely to be associated with direct toxic effects of the DEB itself. After 48 h, all SW43-DOX-DEB treated cancer cells have been eliminated whereas the viability of most of Doxorubicin-DEB treated cells still ranged from 14.81% (0.63) for Panc-1 to 34.92% (1.7) for HT-29 cells, thus demonstrating the superior potency of SW43-DOX-DEB over Doxorubicin-DEB for cancer therapy in vitro. 4. Discussion One of the essential limitations for the majority of conventional chemotherapeutic drugs is their non targeted delivery to the cancer cells leading to similar drug penetration kinetics of normal and cancer tissue. Thus, toxic side effects can lead to restriction of the applicable treatment dose with limited therapeutic effectiveness. When these drugs however are linked with a molecule specifically targeting cancer cells, one could build modular drug conjugates with greater cancer selectivity, thus reaching higher intratumoral treatment concentrations while sparing the normal tissue and potentially limit the systemic side effects. Moreover, the use of these drug conjugates can be extended to a greater application versatility when they are loaded onto particles releasing the conjugate over time in a controlled manner to the environment. As an example, one might primarily think of the intra-arterial application for the locoregional therapy of liver malignancies, commonly known as the drug-eluting bead transarterial chemoembolization (DEB-TACE). Moreover, it may also be suitable for the therapy of compartmentalized tumors such as peritoneal carcinomatosis (Keese et al., 2009) or be injected directly into the tumor (Baltes et al., 2010). We therefore synthesized the novel targeted compound SW43- DOX consisting of the Sigma-2 receptor ligand SW43 and the chemotherapeutic drug Doxorubicin which can be loaded onto DEB representing a potential novel drug delivery platform. The idea to target the Sigma-2 receptor with SW43-DOX evolved from several previous reported observations that the Sigma-2 receptor is known to be overexpressed on a broad variety of rapidly growing cancers, including colorectal and pancreatic adenocarcinoma (Mach et al., 2013; van Waarde et al., 2015). Sigma-2 ligands have been shown to preferentially bind to tumor cells which has been widely shown to be useful for imaging but also for treatment purposes due to the intrinsic anticancer effect of Sigma-2 receptor agonists (Hashim et al., 2014; Hornick et al., 2010; Kashiwagi et al., 2007, 2009; Spitzer et al., 2012). Despite ongoing efforts, the Sigma-2 receptor could not successfully be cloned yet, hence conventional quantification methods such as the Western  Blot or Polymerase Chain Reaction are not applicable (Huang et al., 2014). Therefore, to prove the presence of the Sigma-2 receptor on cancer cells and to semi-quantify the specific cell surface binding capacity, we performed immunofluorescence staining of the Sigma-2 receptor and determined the maximal cell surface binding capacity (Bmax) via saturation binding assay. Here, all cell lines were found to express the Sigma-2 receptor in abundance on the cell surface and could be detected in the cytoplasm but not the nucleus which is in accordance to previous results (Zeng et al., 2007) making all cell lines appropriate study candidates. Sigma-2 receptor ligands also bear the potential for rapid internalization of coupled substances resulting in increased intracellular accumulation (Makvandi et al., 2015; Spitzer et al., 2012; Zeng et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2012). SW43 and the chemically very similar Sigma-2 receptor ligand SV119 have both already been proven as suitable carriers for the internalization of small molecules conjugated onto the tail end without leading to relevant affinity changes of the Sigma-2 receptor binding moiety (Hashim et al., 2014; Hornick et al., 2010; Spitzer et al., 2012). Similar to the previous results, we demonstrated that SW43-DOX specifically binds to the Sigma-2 receptors of all the tested cell lines with high affinity and subsequent rapid internalization proving the potential of SW43-DOX for targeted cancer therapy in contrast to Doxorubicin which rather unselectively penetrates and affects all cells of the body lacking a specific accumulation in tumor tissue (Chen et al., 2016; Dordal et al., 1995; Jackson, 2003). Furthermore, Sigma-2 agonists do not only sensitize for but also act synergistically with chemotherapeutic drugs such as Doxorubicin (Crawford and Bowen, 2002). More specifically, the Sigma-2 receptor ligand SW43 as carrier for Doxorubicin has been chosen due to its previously reported very promising anticancer action in vitro and in vivo as single agent or with concomitant chemotherapeutic drug treatment (Hashim et al., 2014; Hornick et al., 2010). Cancer cell toxicity assessment of free and DEB loaded SW43-DOX demonstrated superiority over the treatment with Doxorubicin. In contrast, after 6 h of treatment, no relevant difference could be found between SW43-DOX, SW43 and SW43 þ Doxorubicin. The data suggests that at early time points, SW43 may be the driving anticancer force of SW43-DOX, especially since the treatment with Doxorubicin alone only minimally affected the cell viability. After 24 h however, the conjugate was superior over the treatment with SW43 or Doxorubicin alone, reconcilable with an additive treatment effect of the SW43 and DOX moieties. However, mixed results were obtained when SW43-DOX and SW43 þ Doxorubicin were compared with greater toxicity for the compound in Panc-1 and HT-29 cells but no relevant difference in HCC cell lines. Thus, it may be speculated that the greater cancer cell toxicity of the SW43- DOX conjugate, compared to the treatment with the unconjugated components, as seen in Panc-1 and HT-29 cells is based on the SW43 mediated specific internalization of Doxorubicin. Sigma-2 ligands including SW43 (Hornick et al., 2010, 2012; Ostenfeld et al., 2005) and Doxorubicin (Fan et al., 2014; Tsang et al., 2003; Wagner et al., 2005; Zhong et al., 2016) have both been reported to induce ROS as part of their anticancer effect mechanism. As expected, we observed a dose dependent ROS increase initiated by SW43-DOX with subsequent cancer cell death which could be partially revoked by complete ROS elimination similar to previous reports for Sigma-2 receptor ligands (Hornick et al., 2010, 2012; Ostenfeld et al., 2005) and Doxorubicin (Wagner et al., 2005). This implies that the SW43-DOX induced cell death is at least partly associated with induced ROS generation initiating several downstream cell death events in cancer cells including mitochondrial dysfunction and lysosomal membrane permeabilization with the release of lysosomal proteases leading to caspase dependent and independent cell death (Broker et al., 2005). The evaluation of the caspase pathway as part of the SW43- DOX induced cell death revealed an activation and a DNA breakage, yet pan-caspase inhibition did not improve cell viability. Also, the combined caspase inhibition and ROS scavenging did not improve viability above the level as seen with concurrent ROS scavenging alone. Another effect mechanism of Doxorubicin is to induce cell death via intercalation with the DNA. However, since SW43-DOX-Cy3 in cell fluorescence staining was not present in the nucleus, future investigations need to elucidate if intracellular cleavage of SW43-DOX to SW43 þ DOX is a component of the cancer toxicity mechanism since this would allow for direct interaction of Doxorubicin with the DNA. In summary, SW43-DOX exerts its cell death via caspase independent mechanism comparable to other Sigma-2 ligands (Hornick et al., 2010, 2012; Ostenfeld et al., 2005) which may be of exceptional relevance since acquired resistance to caspase-mediated cell death is a common encountered problem during cancer therapy (Ostenfeld et al., 2005; Xie et al., 2015). Loading and eluting kinetics as well as viability assessment in vitro suggest a superior potential for SW43-DOX loaded DEB as a treatment platform for locoregional cancer therapy compared to Doxorubicin loaded DEB. Especially patients suffering from liver predominant and treatment refractory primary and secondary liver cancers might benefit from SW43-DOX-DEB-TACE treatment which would allow for higher given doses than tolerated systemically and improve treatment response while largely sparing drug exposure to extratumoral tissue (De Groote and Prenen, 2015; Jarzabek et al., 2011; Kotoyan et al., 2012). Moreover, the occlusion of the tumor feeding arteries through DEB leads to subsequent nutrient and oxygen deprivation which presumably could make the tumors even more susceptible to treatment with SW43-DOX. Despite these very promising findings of our platform concept, in vivo data is needed to test for toxicity and to prove that SW43-DOX specifically accumulates in tumor tissue. 5. Conclusion In summary, we presented a novel platform for the targeted cancer therapy via the Sigma-2 receptor ligand dependent delivery of SW43-DOX which demonstrated superior effectiveness compared to Doxorubicin alone in the in vitro evaluation. Moreover, SW43-DOX offers great application versatility as systemically administered cancer targeted drug but also for locoregional treatment of e.g. liver malignancies when loaded onto DEB and injected into the tumor feeding arteries. We also have shown the expansion possibility to attach a chelator which can be loaded with e.g. Lutetium177 or MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY 10 (2016) 1133 e1145 1143 Yttrium90 for either additional treatment or imaging purposes. However, despite these very promising findings and future possibilities of our platform concept, in vivo testing is warranted to further assess tumor targeting properties as well as treatment efficacy and safety of SW43-DOX.

5	2013	In vitro and in vivo evaluation of gastroretentive floating drug delivery system of ofloxacin	abstract This study aimed to develop hydrophilicmatrix based controlled release gastroretentive drug delivery system of ofloxacin and conducting its in vitro and in vivo evaluations. Effervescent floating gastroretentive drug delivery system of ofloxacin was prepared utilizing Boxe Behnken statistical design with 3 factors, 3 levels and 15 experimental trials. Formulation optimization was done by setting targets on selected responses. In vivo studies were carried out for the optimized formulation with 12 healthy human volunteers and obtained pharmacokinetic parameters were compared with themarketed once daily formulation, “Zanocin OD”. Optimized formulation showed satisfactory controlled in vitro drug release for more than 12 h with excellent buoyancy properties (floating lag time <1 min, floating duration >16 h). Optimized and marketed formulations were found to have similar in vitro release profile ( f2 ¼ 79.22) and also were found to be bioequivalent. Serum ofloxacin concentration was well maintained above its reported minimum inhibitory concentrations for most of the pathogens for sufficiently longer duration. Cmax and AUC values of optimized formulation were found to be significantly higher than of marketed product despite their bioequivalence. Bettertherapeutic effect can be expected since ofloxacin exhibits concentration dependent killing. Hence, gastroretention can be a promising approach to enhance bioavailability of ofloxacin with narrow absorption window in upper GIT.  1. Introduction The importance of controlled drug delivery systems that release drug over an extended period of time has long been recognized in the pharmaceutical field. Application of such controlled release technology to oral drug delivery system however has been limited because the actual time for effective drug delivery is restricted by gastrointestinal transit time. Gastric retention devices are designed to prolong the gastric residence time of oral controlled release dosage forms. They thus result in increased contact time for drugs that act locally, increased absorption of drugs that have absorption windows in upper part of gastrointestinal tract (GIT), and better absorption for drugs less soluble in the intestinal fluid [1]. Several approaches have been developed to achieve extended gastric residence time of the oral drug delivery systems such as bioadhesive system, swelling and expanding systems, floating systems and delayed gastric emptying devices. Amongst these methods, floating drug delivery system is preferred one that offers a simple and practical approach to achieve Gastroretention [2]. Floating dosage forms have a bulk density lower than that of gastric fluids and therefore remain buoyant on the stomach contents to prolong the gastric retention time [3e7]. Ofloxacin is widely used fluoroquinolone and has been reported as one among the five most frequently prescribed antibiotics in Nepal [8]. It is a broad spectrum antibiotic effective against wide range of Gram-negative and Grampositive microorganisms. Biological half life of this drug is from 5 to 6 h due to which frequent administration is required. To avoid the drawbacks of frequent administrations such as plasma level fluctuations and patient non-compliance it is desirable to have a controlled release dosage forms of ofloxacin. It has been reported that bioavailability of ofloxacin is strongly dependent on the local physiology of GIT. It is readily soluble in the acidic environment of the stomach and thus is preferentially absorbed from the upper part of GIT [9]. In the alkaline environment of intestine, precipitation of the drug occurs decreasing its absorption. This study was conducted with an aim to develop floating gastroretentive tablet formulation incorporating 400 mg ofloxacin into hydrophilic polymeric matrix which would release the drug in stomach and upper part of GIT in a controlled manner. Since ofloxacin has site-specific absorption from these regions, gastroretention of the dosage form will improve its oral bioavailability [10e12]. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Materials Ofloxacin (Batch no. A5/206), hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC) K100M (Batch no. HP121406 MC) and crosspovidone (Batch no. YPVPP09319040) were obtained from Nepal Pharmaceutical Laboratories Pvt. Ltd., Birgunj, Nepal as gift samples. Sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3), citric acid, polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP K-30), magnesium stearate, lactose and isopropyl alcohol were purchased from local suppliers. Marketed product, “Zanocin OD”, (manufactured by Ranbaxy, India; Batch no. 2033597), used as a reference, was purchased from the local retail pharmacy. 2.2. BoxeBehnken statistical design One of the widely used response surface designs, a BoxeBehnken statistical design with 3 factors, 3 levels, and 15 runs with triplicate center points was employed for the formulation of floating gastroretentive tablets of ofloxacin. Formulation design, optimization and other investigations were done using Statgraphics Centurion XV software from Stat-Point Technologies, USA, version 15.2.06. The independent variables or the factors were the amount of HPMC K100M (X1), crosspovidone (X2) and NaHCO3 (X3). Levels of these factors were set in the formulation design on the basis of the results of preliminary study and are coded as 1, 0, and þ1 (Table 1). The responses selected were the cumulative percentage drug release at 2 h (Y1), 8 h (Y2) and 12 h (Y3), floating lag time (Y4) and the total floating time (Y5). Formulation optimization was done by setting targets for these response variables. 2.3. Preparation of floating gastroretentive tablets Tablets were prepared by conventional wet granulation method using HPMC K100M as a release retardant, crosspovidone as a swelling agents and NaHCO3 as gas generating agent. Citric acid was also incorporated in the formulation to provide sufficiently acidic medium for NaHCO3 to react and maintain buoyancy. The compositions of designed 15 formulations are listed in Table 2. All ingredients (except gas generating agents and magnesium stearate) were passed through sieve no. 60 and mixed in a polybag for 10 min and granulated using PVP K30 (in isopropyl alcohol). The wet mass was passed through sieve number 14 and dried in hot air oven at 50 C for 1.5 h. Dried granules were mixed with remaining ingredients and compressed using 16-station rotary tablet press (Rimek Minipress-I, India) using 13 mm flat punch in order to obtain controlled release floating gastroretentive tablets containing 400 mg of ofloxacin. 2.4. In vitro analysis 2.4.1. In vitro drug release study Drug release from the tablets was studied using USP dissolution apparatus (Electrolab TDT-081, India), type I (basket method). A tablet was placed inside a basket and immersed in a dissolution vessel (n ¼ 6) containing 900 ml of 0.1 N HCl (pH 1.2), used as dissolution media at 37  0.5 C and stirred at a speed of 100 rpm. The amount of drug released after 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 and 16 h was determined using UVevisible spectrophotometer (Shimadzu Corporation, 1601, Japan) at 294 nm. Release profiles of the designed formulations were compared with that of the marketed formulation, “Zanocin OD”. Similarity and difference factors were calculated using appropriate formulas. 2.4.2. In vitro buoyancy study The floating property of the tablets was visually determined in triplicate. The floating lag time and the total floating time were determined in the USP dissolution apparatus containing 0.1 N HCl (pH 1.2, maintained at 37  0.5 C). The time required for the tablet to rise to the surface of the medium and float was considered as floating lag time. The duration of time the dosage form remained constantly on the surface of medium was considered as the total floating time. 2.4.3. Drug release kinetics In vitro release data were subjected to model fitting analysis to know the order of drug release by treating the data according to zero order, first order and Higuchi’s release kinetic equations. Since these kinetic models are generally unable to explain the drug release mechanism from polymeric matrices that undergo swelling and/or erosion during dissolution process, the release data were further fitted into RitgerePeppas empirical equation [7,13,14]. According to this equation, Mt MN ¼ Ktn Here, Mt/MN is the fractional drug release at time t; K is the release rate constant and n is the diffusional exponent indicative of the release mechanism. 2.4.4. Compatibility of ofloxacin with excipients To investigate the chemical interaction, Fourier Transformed Infra Red (FTIR) analysis of admixture of ofloxacin and the excipients used in the formulation were carried out over the range of 400e4000 cm1 using FTIR spectrometer (Shimadzu, IR Prestige 21, se Japan). The spectra produced by the pure drug alone and in combination with excipients were compared to confirm the interaction. 2.5. In vivo evaluation In order to ascertain the pharmacokinetic property and expected clinical efficacy, in vivo evaluation of the optimized formulation containing 400 mg ofloxacin was carried out. Open label, randomized, two treatments, two periods, two sequences, single dose, two ways crossover comparative bioavailability study was conducted using healthy human subjects. Prior ethical approval was taken from the Institutional Review Committee (IRC) of Kathmandu University School of Medical Sciences/Dhulikhel Hospital (IRC KUSMS), for carrying out this study (Protocol approval number: 34/11). Pharmacokinetic data of optimized formulation was compared with in vivo data of marketed extended release product of ofloxacin 400mg (Zanocin OD, Batch no. 1760135). Twelve healthy, non-smoking, adult Nepalese male volunteers were enrolled in the study. Written informed consent was obtained from each subject after adequate explanation of the objectives, methods and potential hazards of the study. All volunteers gave medical screening examination before dosing to establish their fitness to participate in the study. Enrolled volunteers were randomly divided into two groups. One group administered optimized formulation and another group administered marketed formulation, “Zanocin OD” on the first study day under fasting condition. After a washout period of 7 days, on the second study day, volunteers exchanged formulations. In both study days, 5 ml of pre-dose blood sample was collected 15 min before drug administration. Later blood sample was collected at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 16 and 24 h of drug administration. Blood samples were collected in vacutainer tubes without anticoagulant. It was allowed to clot at room temperature for 20 min followed by centrifuging for 15 min at 5000 rpm. Serum was transferred into a separate serum container and was promptly frozen at 40 C until assay. 2.6. Drug analysis 2.6.1. Sample preparation To 180 ml of thawed human serum sample, 20 ml of ciprofloxacin (internal standard) was added and vortex mixed for 30 s. 600 ml of methanol was added to the tube. After mixing for another 1 min the tube was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 min using a cooling centrifuge (Remi, India). 20 ml of filtered supernatant was injected into the HPLC column for analysis. 2.6.2. Chromatographic conditions Serum samples were analyzed for ofloxacin with a validated bioanalytical method using HPLC (Shimadzu, Japan) comprising of a pump (LC-20AD), autosampler (SIL-20AD), photo-diode array detector (SPD-M20A) and a column oven (CTO-10 ASVP). The data collection and integration was accomplished using LC solutions software. Separation was performed on a reverse phase CAPCELL PAK C18, MG type column (250 mm length, 4.6 mm internal diameter, 5 mm particle size) from Shiseido Fine Chemicals. Mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile and 0.0625% triethylamine in water (12.5: 87.5, pH adjusted to 2.5 with orthophosphoric acid) was delivered at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. The system was operated at wavelength of 294 nm and temperature of column oven was set at 40 C. The peaks of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were resolved with good symmetry. The retention time for ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin was 8.2  0.8 and 9.3  0.76 min respectively.

The bioanalytical method was validated as per ICH guidelines. The serum drug concentrationetime data was subjected to non-compartmental analysis using a pharmacokinetic software, WinNonlin, standard edition, version 5.2.1 (Pharsight Corporation, USA), to obtain various pharmacokinetic parameters. Relative bioavailability was determined as the ratio of AUC0eN of optimized formulation to the AUC0eN of marketed product. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Compatibility of ofloxacin with excipients FTIR study revealed absence of potential chemical interaction between the drug and excipients. The infrared spectrum of ofloxacin alone showed characteristic peaks at 3427, 3043, 2968, 2785, 1716, 1620, 1550, 1458, 1056 cm1 [15]. All of these typical peaks of ofloxacin remained unaffected in the spectrum of ofloxacin in combination with HPMC K100M and also in presence of other excipients used in the formulation. 3.2. In vitro buoyancy Most of the formulations were found to have good buoyancy properties (Table 3). They floated immediately upon immersion in to the media and remained floated for 16 h. NaHCO3 and citric acid were employed as gas forming agents dispersed in the matrix and this formulation was found to be appropriate for achieving desired buoyancy characteristics. Addition of NaHCO3 was found essential to ensure rapid floating. Furthermore, since the pH of the stomach is elevated under fed condition (w3.5), citric acid was also incorporated in the formulation to provide sufficiently acidic medium for NaHCO3 to react. This will allow the system to float independent of the pH of the medium. Upon immersion, NaHCO3 starts reaction immediately with the acidic dissolution media and added citric acid. This reaction generates sufficient amount of CO2 which get entrapped and protected within the gel layer formed by hydration of HPMC K100M. This leads to decreased density of the tablet (reported as 1.004e1.010 g/cm3 ), as a result of which the tablet becomes buoyant [2,3,5,11,16e18]. Buoyancy property is further facilitated by relatively good acid solubility of ofloxacin which causes faster penetration of dissolution media into the matrix. This in turn causes quicker initiation of reaction resulting in faster generation of CO2 making the tablets more buoyant. It has been reported in several literatures that the amount of NaHCO3 is directly related to the floating lag time [3,11,19e21]. As the amount of NaHCO3 increases, floating lag time decreases due to the generation of larger amount of effervescence. However in this study, quantity of HPMC K100M was found to have more prominent effect on floating characteristics instead. Formulation containing higher amount of HPMC K100M had better buoyancy property. Decreasing its amount decreased floating duration and increased floating lag time [20,22]. This effect is more noticeable in formulations containing lesser amount of NaHCO3. When floating characteristics of the fifteen formulations were compared, a longer floating lag time and a shorter duration of floating were observed in formulations F1, F10, F11 and F14 containing least (40 mg per tablet) amount of HPMC K100M (Table 3). The matrix formed with lower concentration of this polymer seems not to be capable enough to hold the bubbles and float. Also there was quicker loss of tablet shape integrity in these formulations which have further worsened their buoyancy property. 3.3. In vitro drug release In vitro drug release and buoyancy study revealed that values of responses for these 15 formulations varied markedly indicating strong relationship between responses and the factors (Table 3). The range of response Y1 was from 28.84% in F12 to 61.64% in F10. Response Y2 ranged from 53.98% in F12 to a maximum of 81.09% in F1. Similarly another response Y3 was in the range of 68.99 in F6 to 100% in F10. Majority of the formulations extended the drug release for 16 h. Drug release from the hydrophillic matrix tablet is known to be a complex interaction between diffusion, swelling, and erosion mechanisms. These processes are controlled by the hydration of HPMC, which forms the gel barrier through which the drug diffuses [23]. Higher polymer concentration increase the diffusion path length for the drug due to forming greater amount of gel which retard drug release from the formulation. The growth of erosion front, diffusion front, and swelling front decrease with the increase in polymer proportion because of the formation of a stronger gel layer, which make the entry of medium into the matrix difficult [24e27]. In the present formulation design, amount of HPMC K100M varied from 40 to 100 mg per tablet (5e12% of total tablet weight). Formulations F1, F10, F11 and F14, containing low concentration of HPMC K100M, gave high release rate of 50.62%, 61.64%, 48.89% and 41.64% respectively at the end of 2 h. Also these formulations completed drug release within a short time. When quantity of HPMC K100M was increased to 100 mg per tablet in formulations F3, F5, F6 and F8, release at the end of 2 h decreased down to 34.29%, 31.26%, 29.91% and 39.51% respectively. These formulations successfully extended drug release for sufficiently longer duration. At the end of 16 h drug release from formulations F3, F5, F6 and F8 were found to be 93.08, 93.02, 80.01 and 90.54% respectively. It has been observed that high release occurred in all designed formulations at the end of 2 h. Marketed product also gave a high release rate of 37.08% at the end of 2 h. Such type of release could be due to the reason that the gel layer, which controls drug release needs sometime to become effective. Till the gel barrier is being formed, high rate of erosion occurs resulting in high initial drug release [23,27,28]. After some time release rate slows down as polymer hydration occurs. In vitro release data were fitted in to different release kinetic models and it was observed that regression coefficient was highest for the Higuchi model (except for F10 & F11). The n values for all formulations, except F1, F10, F11 and F14, were found to be lying within the range of 0.45e0.89, indicating anomalous or non-Fickian type of diffusion to be the predetermining mechanism of drug release. Mathematical relationships for the measured responses and the independent variables or factors were generated with the help of software Statgraphics Centurion XV and are shown in Equations (1)e(5). These equations represent the quantitative effect of variables (X1, X2, X3) and their interactions on the response. Coefficient with more than one factor term and those with higher order terms represent interaction terms and quadratic relationship respectively. A positive sign represents synergistic effect, while a negative sign indicates antagonistic effect or an inverse relationship between the factors and response [29]. Correlation coefficient (r 2 ) for the equations indicates the percentage variability in model fitting for that particular variable. The adjusted r 2 value is more suitable for comparing models with different number of independent variables which can be obtained by including only statistically significant (P < 0.05) coefficients in the equation. In this study final equation was considered with maximum adjusted r 2 value. The adjusted r 2 value for responses Y1, Y2, Y3 and Y5 were found to be 79.97, 80.51, 84.73 and 88.27% respectively, which indicate good fit. When ANOVA was performed at 95% confidence interval to estimate the significance of the model, factors X1 (HPMC) and X3 (NaHCO3) were identified as critical influencing parameters for selected responses Y1, Y2 and Y3. Another response, Y5, i.e. the total floating time was found to be affected significantly by the amount of HPMC (X1) and CP (X2) whilst no significant effect of formulation variables was observed on Y4, i.e. floating lag time. Y1 ¼ 111:946  1:518X1  0:195X3 þ 0:009$X2 1 (1) r 2 ¼ 86:41%; r 2ðadjustedÞ ¼ 79:97% Y2 ¼ 169:080  1:456X1 þ 0:587X2  1:351X3 þ 0:004X2 1  0002X1X2 þ 0:012X1X3  0:002X2 2 (2) r 2 ¼ 87:43%; r 2ðadjustedÞ ¼ 80:51% Y3 ¼ 173:766  1:130X1 þ 0:908X2  1:775X3 þ 0:005X2 1  0008X1X2 þ 0:014X1X3  0:003X2 2 þ 0:004X2X3 (3) r 2 ¼ 86:39%; r 2ðadjustedÞ ¼ 84:73% Y4 ¼ 932:302  5:271X1  19:122X3 þ 0:031X2 1 þ 0:127X2 3 (4) r 2 ¼ 37:53%; r 2ðadjustedÞ ¼ 20:50% Y5 ¼ 121:083 þ 0:949X1 þ 0:294X2 þ 2:042X3  0:005X2 1  0:002X2 2  0:014X3 (5) r 2 ¼ 92:46%; r 2ðadjustedÞ ¼ 88:27% 3.4. Formulation optimization and evaluation For formulation optimization, target values for the responses (Y1 e Y5) were set on the basis of in vitro drug release and buoyancy study of marketed product, “Zanocin OD” (Table 4). Composition of the optimized formulation given by the software using this technique termed as “multiple response optimization” is shown in Table 5. This combination maximized the desirability over the indicated region to 0.93 (Fig. 1). Optimized formulation had good physicochemical properties and was found to fulfill the requirement of an optimum controlled release formulation because of better regulation of drug release at the end of 2, 8 and 12 h. The predicted release profile, given by the software was found to be quite close to the profile obtained experimentally which indicates the validity of the developed model (Table 6). Floating lag time of optimized formulation was 2.56 s and it remained floated for more than 16 h in vitro. Thus, besides controlling drug release for an extended duration, the formulation seemed to have an excellent floating potential which is prerequisite for prolong residence of the dosage form in the stomach. The respective release profiles of the marketed and optimized formulation superimposed over each other which indicates analogy of their release performances (Fig. 2). Comparison of release profile of optimized and marketed formulations gave similarity factor ( f2) of 79.22 and difference factor ( f1) of 3.84. Table 6 shows the comparison of the response variables and other release parameters of these formulations. Percentage cumulative drug release at 2 (Y1), 8 (Y2) and 12 h (Y3) from optimized formulation were found to be quite close to that of marketed product. Buoyancy parameters like floating lag time (Y4) and total floating duration (Y5) of these formulations were also lying in close proximity to each other (Table 6). Drug release from both optimized and marketed formulation followed Higuchi’s release kinetics and the values of n were found to be 0.52 and 0.55 respectively suggesting the release mechanism to be anomalous transport. 3.5. Pharmacokinetic evaluation The mean serum concentration versus time profiles of the optimized and marketed formulations were similar and nearly superimposable (Fig. 3). Pharmacokinetic parameters of these formulations are presented in Table 7. 90% confidence interval of the ratio of mean AUC0e24, AUC0eN and Cmax of the optimized to marketed formulation were found to be in the range of 94.27%e103.85%; 99.97%e 110.11% and 98.59e111.86% respectively. These values are within the bioequivalence accepted range of 80%e125% [30,31]. Thus, the two formulations can be regarded bioequivalent and hence interchangeable. 4. Conclusions Controlled release floating gastroretentive tablet dosage form of ofloxacin was successfully developed using BoxeBehnken statistical design. Serum drug level monitoring in human subjects for 24 h showed extended drug release for sufficiently longer duration making its once daily administration sufficient. Serum ofloxacin concentration was maintained well above the reported minimum inhibitory concentrations for most of the pathogens for longer duration. The optimized formulation, when compared to the conventional immediate release preparation, seems to be promising for improving bioavailability of ofloxacin for enhancing its therapeutic efficacy along with improving patient convenience due to less frequent dosing requirement.

6	2014	Solid lipid nanoparticles for nose to brain delivery of haloperidol: in vitro drug release and pharmacokinetics evaluation	Abstract In the present study, haloperidol (HP)-loaded solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) were prepared to enhance the uptake of HP to brain via intranasal (i.n.) delivery. SLNs were prepared by a modified emulsification–diffusion technique and evaluated for particle size, zeta potential, drug entrapment efficiency, in vitro drug release, and stability. All parameters were found to be in an acceptable range. In vitro drug release was found to be 94.1674.78% after 24 h and was fitted to the Higuchi model with a very high correlation coefficient (R2 ¼0.9941). Pharmacokinetics studies were performed on albino Wistar rats and the concentration of HP in brain and blood was measured by high performance liquid chromatography. The brain/blood ratio at 0.5 h for HP-SLNs i.n., HP sol. i.n. and HP sol. i.v. was 1.61, 0.17 and 0.031, respectively, indicating direct nose-to-brain transport, bypassing the blood–brain barrier. The maximum concentration (Cmax) in brain achieved from i.n. administration of HP-SLNs (329.17720.89 ng/mL, Tmax 2 h) was significantly higher than that achieved after i.v. (76.9577.62 ng/mL, Tmax 1 h), and i.n. (90.1376.28 ng/mL, Tmax 2 h) administration of HP sol. The highest drug-targeting efficiency (2362.43%) and direct transport percentage (95.77%) was found with HP-SLNs as compared to the other formulations. Higher DTE (%) and DTP (%) suggest that HP-SLNs have better brain targeting efficiency as compared to other formulations. 1. Introduction Nanotechnology has several applications in the ‘real world’ 1 . It encompasses the production and application of physical, chemical and biological systems at submicron level as well as the integration of resulting nanostructures into larger systems2,3 . Over the past two decades, there has been a marked improvement in our understanding of the underlying etiology and treatment of central nervous system (CNS) disorders4 . However, many of the drugs used to treat these disorders lack an effective means for crossing the blood–brain barrier (BBB)5 . The BBB presents a great obstacle to the transport of exogenous substances into the brain. Thus, various approaches like BBB disruption (osmotic and biochemical), drug manipulation (prodrug, lipophilic analogs, chemical drug delivery, carrier mediated drug delivery, and receptor/vector-mediated drug delivery) and alteration in the route of administration, including intracerebroventricular, intrathecal, and olfactory pathways (intranasal route) are used for the targeting of drugs to the brain6 . In the present scenario, the intranasal route to bypass the BBB is explored, as this route provides a novel, practical, simple and non-invasive approach to bypass the blood brain barrier and reduces the systemic exposure and thus systemic adverse effects7 . Drug after intranasal administration reaches the olfactory epithelium region of the nasal mucosa that acts as a gateway for substances entering the CNS due to the neural connection between the nasal mucosa and the brain8 . Haloperidol (HP) is a dopamine inverse agonist of the typical antipsychotic class of medications that chemically belongs to butyrophenone group. It occurs as a white crystalline powder and is chemically known as 4-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-[4-(4-fluorophenyl)- 4-oxobutyl]-4-piperidinol] with molecular weight of 375.86 g/mol and log P¼3.36. Its mechanism of action is mediated by blockade of D2 dopamine receptors in brain9 . It is used to treat certain psychiatric conditions including schizophrenia, manic states, medication-induced psychosis and neurological disorders with hyperkinesias10. It is also used to treat extreme behavior problems in children and to ease the symptoms of Tourette's syndrome11. After oral drug delivery, the drug undergoes first-pass metabolism followed by systemic distribution, resulting in only a small portion being able to reach the brain through the blood12,13. The plasma– protein binding of HP is about 90%, thereby further affecting oral bioavailability12. Specific clinical complications associated with a high systemic concentration include respiratory disturbance (bronchospasm and increased depth of respiration), dermatological reactions (maculopapular and acneiform skin reactions), nausea, vomiting and musculoskeletal disorder14–16. Therefore, a drug delivery system is required which not only provides rapid and targeted delivery to brain but also reduces systemic exposure. Attempts have been made to bypass the BBB, and it has been demonstrated in earlier studies that the intranasal route bypasses the BBB17. Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) were introduced in 1991 as submicron colloidal carriers (50–1000 nm). They are used for both hydrophilic and lipophilic drug(s) which are trapped in biocompatible lipid core made up of a lipid or combination of lipids like compritol 888 ATO, precirol ATO 5, glyceryl monostearate, palmitic acid, stearic acid, as well as others, and stabilized by surfactant present at the outer shell18. SLNs have the several advantages including targeted drug delivery and controlled release delivery, and increase bioavailability so as to reduce the dose and adverse effects19. SLNs with polymeric nanoparticles offer lower toxicity. They have good tolerability and biodegradability, lack of acute and chronic toxicity of the carrier, and scalability20,21. SLNs offer an improvement to traditional nose-to-brain drug delivery since they are able to protect the encapsulated drug from biological and/or chemical degradation and may also increase nasal retention time due to an occlusive effect, good application properties, and adhesion of the SLNs to mucous membranes17. The objectives of the current study were to evaluate HP-SLNs prepared by the modified solvent emulsification–diffusion technique, study the stability of the optimized formulation, and the pharmacokinetics of optimized HP-SLNs after intranasal administration. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Materials Haloperidol (HP) was received as a gift from Vamsi Labs Ltd. (Solapur, Maharashtra, India). Compritol ATO 888, glyceryl monostearate (GMS) and Precirol ATO 5 were obtained as a gift from Gattefosse (Witten, Germany). Stearic acid, palmitic acid, acetonitrile (ACN), triethylamine (TEA), o-phosphoric acid (o-PA) and Tween 80 along with all the other chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (New Delhi, India). ACN, TEA, o-PA were high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-grade while all other solvents and chemicals used were of analytical grade. Water was distilled and filtered before use through a 0.22 mm membrane filter. 2.2. Methods 2.2.1. Excipients selection Solubility of drug in melted lipid is one of the most important factors that determine the encapsulation efficiency of a drug in lipid. However, equilibrium solubility studies cannot be carried out in this case. Hence, we used a modified method to identify the solid lipid having best solubilization potential for drug22. GMS, compritol ATO 888, precirol ATO 5, stearic acid and palmitic acid were screened for their potential to solubilize HP. HP (20 mg) was placed in a screw-cap vial. The solid lipids were separately heated above their melting point. These lipid melts were gradually added in portions to the vial containing HP with continuous stirring using a vortex mixer and maintaining the same temperature (above the melting point of lipid). The end point was the formation of a clear, pale yellow solution of molten lipid. The amount of molten lipid required to solubilize the HP was noted visually. The experiment was performed in triplicate. The compatibility between the lipids and drug was identified by Fourier transform-infrared spectrophotometer (Alpha model Bruker ATRFTIR spectrophotometer). IR spectra of drug, lipid and a physical mixture of drug and lipid (1:1) were scanned from 4000 cm1 to 400 cm1 and recorded. 2.2.2. Preparation of SLNs In a preliminary laboratory study, various factors like ratio of drug to lipid (1:2), surfactant concentration (Tween 80, 1.5% w/v), ratio of chloroform to ethanol (1:1, 2.5% v/v) (as the solvent for drug and lipid), homogenization time (30 min), stirring time (2 h), stirring speed (2500 rpm), and sonication time (5 min) were fixed and their effect on particle size and entrapment efficiency was determined. Factors like ratio of drug to lipid, surfactant concentration, stirring speed and stirring time were further optimized in this study. All of the experiments were performed in triplicate and the averages were considered as the response. Table 1 shows the composition of various batches. Drug-loaded SLNs were prepared by the modified solvent emulsification–diffusion technique19,23–25. Accurately weighed lipid (87.5–100 mg) was dissolved in a 2.5 mL mixture of ethanol and chloroform (1:1) as the internal oil phase. Drug (43.75–50 mg, ratio of drug to lipid 1:2) was dispersed in the above solution. This organic phase was then added drop by drop into a homogenizer tube containing 22.5 mL of an aqueous solution of Tween 80 (1.5–1.625% w/v) as the external aqueous phase and homogenized for 30 min at 3000 rpm (Remi Instruments Pvt. Ltd., India) to form a primary emulsion (o/w). The above primary emulsion was poured into 75 mL of ice-cold water (2–3 1C) containing surfactant (1.5–1.625% w/v) and stirred to extract the organic solvent into the continuous phase and for proper solidification of SLNs. The stirring was continued for 2–2.5 h at 3000 rpm to disperse the SLNs. The SLN dispersion was sonicated for 5 min (1 cycle, 100% amplitude, Bandelin sonoplus, Germany) to produce SLN dispersions of uniform size. The dispersion was then centrifuged at 18,000 rpm for 20 min (Remi Instruments Pvt., Ltd., India) to separate the solid lipid material containing the drug and washed with deionized water several time to ensure the complete removal of organic solvent. This was then redispersed in 1.5–1.625% (w/v) of an aqueous surfactant mixture of Tween 80 and sonicated for 5 min to obtain the SLNs. The SLN dispersions were lyophilized in the presence of 5% (w/v) mannitol as a cryoprotectant. 2.2.3. Particle size, zeta potential and morphology study Average particle size, polydispersity index (PDI) and zeta potential were measured by photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS; Zetasizer, HAS 3000; Malvern Instruments, Malvern, UK). The analysis was performed at 25 1C with an angle of detection 901 26. Surface morphology of optimized SLNs (OPH) was determined by using transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Philips CM 10, Holland). To perform the TEM observation, SLN dispersions (approx. 10 mL) were dropped on a 300 mesh copper grid coated with carbon film and allowed to sit for 10 min until air-dried. After complete drying the sample was stained with 2% w/v phosphotungstic acid solution with several replications and dried at room temperature. Digital micrograph and Soft Imaging Viewer software were used to perform the image capture and analysis. 2.2.4. Drug loading and drug entrapment efficiency determination A fixed quantity of HP-SLN dispersions (10 mL) was fractionated (Remi Instruments, Pvt. Ltd., India) at 18,000 rpm for 20 min at 20 1C23. The supernatant fraction was analyzed spectrophotometrically at λmax of 247.5 nm (Shimadzu 1800, Japan) for determination of unencapsulated drug27,28. The drug loading (%) and drug entrapment efficiency (%) were calculated by using the following equations21,23: Drug loadingð%Þ ¼ ð Þ Wt–Ws =ð Þ Wt–Ws þ WL 100 ð1Þ Drug entrapment efficiency ð%Þ ¼ ð Þ Wt–Ws =Wt  100 ð2Þ where Wt is the total weight of drug used, Ws is the weight of drug in the supernatant after centrifugation and WL is the weight of the lipid used in preparing the SLNs. 2.2.5. X-ray diffractometric analysis X-ray powder diffraction patterns of drug, lipid and optimized HPSLNs were measured by X-ray diffractometer (PANanalytical, X’Pert Pro model, Germany) equipped with an X-ray generator. Analysis was performed on the samples using Cu Kα radiation (45 kV, 40 mA) and scanned from 51 to 901 (2θ). The scanning rate is 21/min using an automatic divergence slit assembly and a proportional detector. Samples were scanned at 25 1C 29. 2.2.6. Differential scanning calorimetry The thermograms of drug, lipid and optimized HP-SLNs were recorded with a DSC (Pyris 6 DSC Perkin Elmer, CT, USA) under an inert atmosphere which was maintained by purging with nitrogen. Sample (5 mg) was loaded into an aluminum pan and sealed tightly. An empty aluminum pan was used as a reference. Samples were heated at a scanning rate of 10 1C/min over a temperature range between 40–230 1C and the thermograms were recorded30. 2.2.7. In vitro drug release and release kinetics study Drug release from HP-SLNs was determined using a dialysis bag diffusion technique using a dialysis membrane (Himedia, molecular weight cut off 12,000–14,000 D)31. An accurately weighed amount of HP-SLN containing the drug equivalent to 10 mg was transferred to a dialysis bag and sealed. The sealed bag was then suspended in a beaker containing 100 mL of phosphate buffer pH 7.4 and stirred at a constant speed at 3770.5 1C. Aliquots were withdrawn at predetermined time intervals up to 24 h from receiver compartment (beaker) and replaced with an equal volume of fresh medium to maintain a ‘sink’ condition. The samples were analyzed spectrophotometrically at λmax of 247.5 nm (Shimadzu 1800, Japan). In vitro release data was fitted to zero order, first order and Higuchi release models32,33. The percent cumulative amount of drug release versus time was plotted for zero kinetics, log percent drug remaining versus time was plotted for first order kinetics and percent cumulative amount of drug release versus square root of time was plotted for the Higuchi release model and the correlation coefficient was determined for each model. Initial equations for various models are given below: Zero order model : X ¼ Kt ð3Þ First order model : log X ¼ Kt=2:303 ð4Þ Higuchi release model : X ¼ K tð Þ1=2 ð5Þ where X is the amount of drug released, K is the release rate constant, and t is time. To construct the plot for zero order and the Higuchi model, percent cumulative drug release determined, and for the first order model, log percent drug remaining was determined. 2.2.8. Stability study The stability study was carried out to determine the effect of the presence of formulation additives on the stability of drug and also to determine the physical stability of the prepared formulation under conditions of storage temperature and relative humidity34. The optimized HP-SLNs were subjected to stability studies and the studies were performed in triplicate. The storage conditions used for stability testing were 472 1C (refrigerator), 2572 1C/ 6075% RH, and 4072 1C/7575% in a stability chamber (Hicon instruments, N. Delhi). The sample was withdrawn after a period of 0, 1, 3 and 6 months and the effect on particles size, PDI, zeta potential, entrapment efficiency and loading capacity was determined. 2.2.9. Pharmacokinetics study A pharmacokinetic study was performed with male albino Wistar rats (adult/weighing 200–250 g). A protocol for animal studies was approved by Institutional animal ethical committee and project number was 03. The animals were kept under standard laboratory conditions, temperature of 2273 1C and relative humidity of 30%–70%. The animals were housed in polypropylene cages, 6 animals per cage with free access to standard laboratory diet and water ad libitum. Rats were divided into three groups: group A, positive control for intravenous (i.v.) drug administration (HP sol.); group B, positive control for intranasal (i.n.) drug administration (HP sol.); and group C, intranasal (i.n.) formulation administration (HP-SLNs). Each group was further divided into 8 subgroups on time basis as 0.167, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24 h, with each group receiving drug at time 0 and then analyzed at the indicated time. Each subgroup contained 6 animals. The dose for rats was calculated based on the body weight and surface area ratio of the rat35. Surface area ratio calculated for a 200 g rat relevant to a 70 kg human is 56. The equation is 56 ¼ dose for human=x ð6Þ where x is rat dose per 200 g and the dose of HP for human is 10 mg. x¼0.179 mg for 200 g of rat on this basis; the dose required for rat of 1 kg is 0.893 mg. Drug solution (positive control), containing 0.179 mg (for 200 g of rat) of HP (equivalent to 0.89 mg/kg body weight), was injected through the tail vein (10 mL) of one group of Wistar rats. Similarly, drug solution and drug formulation (HP-SLNs) containing 0.179 mg of HP were administered in each nostril in the other two groups with the help of micropipette (10–100 mL) with 0.1 mm internal diameter at the delivery site. The rats were anaesthetized prior to nasal administration by pentobarbital sodium (35–50 mg/kg, i.p.) and held firmly from the back in a slanted position during nasal administration. The rats were killed humanely by an overdose of pentobarbital sodium at the designated time intervals (0.167, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24 h) and the blood was collected using cardiac puncture in EDTA-coated Eppendorf tubes. The blood was fractionated at 4000 rpm for 20 min and aliquots of the supernatant separated and stored at 21 1C until drug analysis was carried out using HPLC36. At the same interval of blood collection, the rats were sacrificed to remove the brain. Brain was rinsed twice with normal saline, made free from adhering tissue/fluid and weighed. Cold normal saline solution was added (brain weight: normal saline, 1:5) to the brain and homogenized. The homogenate was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 20 min with the temperature of 4 1C, and aliquots of the supernatant were separated and stored at –21 1C until drug analysis was carried out using HPLC37,38. Chromatographic separation was achieved with a Cosmosil C18 column (250 mm  4.6 mm, particle size 5 mm). The mobile phase consisted of 100 mmol/L potassium dihydrogen phosphate–acetonitrile–TEA (10:90:0.1, v/v/v) and the pH was adjusted with o-phosphoric acid to 3.5. The mobile phase was sonicated for 15 min and filtered through a 0.22 μm membrane filter before use. The flow rate of the mobile phase was maintained at 2 mL/min and eluents were monitored at 230 nm. Twenty μL of sample was injected using an HPLC injector. All determinations were performed at ambient temperature for a run time of 5 min. The extraction of HP from plasma and brain samples was carried out using the liquid–liquid extraction (LLE) technique. Plasma sample and homogenized brain tissue (0.5 mL) were mixed with 100 mL loratidine (100 ng/mL) as an internal standard39,40. The mixture was shaken with 2 mL isopropyl alcohol for 2 min on a vortex mixer and then fractionated at 4000 rpm for 10 min until a clear organic layer was separated. The organic layer was evaporated to dryness under nitrogen gas at room temperature. Dried sample was then reconstituted with 0.3 mL mobile phase and evaluated by HPLC for the presence of HP. Plasma concentration–time profiles of HP after i.n. and i.v. delivery were evaluated with pharmacokinetic software (PK Functions for Microsoft Excel, Pharsight Corporation, Mountain View, CA, USA). Various pharmacokinetic parameters such as Cmax, Tmax, AUC0–1, AUMC0–1, elimination rate constant and MRT were calculated. The percent brain targeting efficiency (DTE%) and nose-to-brain direct transport percentage (DTP%) were calculated with the help of the following formulae41. DTEð%Þ¼½ AUCbrain=AUCblood  024; i:n: =ðAUCbrain=AUCbloodÞ024; i:v:   100 ð7Þ DTPð%Þ ¼ ½ðAUC024; brain; i:n:–FÞ=AUC0–24; brain; i:n:  100 ð8Þ where F¼(AUC0–24, brain, i.v./AUC0–24, blood, i.v.)  AUC0–24, blood, i.n., AUC0–24, brain, i.n. is the area under the curve of brain following i.n. administration, AUC0–24, brain, i.v. is the area under the curve of brain following i.v. administration, AUC0–24 blood, i.v. is the area under the curve of blood following i.v. administration, and AUC0–24 blood, i.n. is the area under the curve of blood following i.n. administration. 2.2.10. Statistical analysis All data are reported as mean7standard deviation (SD). Differences between the groups were tested using Student's t-test and differences among more than two groups were compared using ANOVA (analysis of variance). A P-value o0.05 was considered statistically significant. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Excipients selection Excipients used for formulation development should be pharmaceutically acceptable, non-irritating, and non-sensitizing in nature. They should be generally regarded as safe. For the SLNs development, selection of a suitable lipid and surfactant is important. Solubility of drug in the lipid is a determinant of encapsulation efficiency. It is expected that high lipid solubility will result in high encapsulation efficiency42. Solubility studies indicated that in comparison of GMS, Compritol 888 ATO, precirol ATO 5, stearic acid and palmitic acid, GMS effectively solubilised the HP (Table 2). The solubilising potential, coupled with already reported biocompatibility and acceptability of GMS for nose to brain and parenteral route delivery favours its selection for the present study23. The FTIR spectra over the range of 400–4000 cm1 for HP, GMS and physical mixture of HP and GMS are shown in Fig. 1. Important peaks at 3120 cm1 appeared the characteristic peak of OH stretch, at 2951 cm1 aromatic CH group stretch, at 2911 cm1 aliphatic CH2 stretch, at 1676 cm1 and 1587 cm1 corresponded to CQO carbonyl stretching and a substituted aromatic ring, respectively, at 1138 cm1 CH deformation of F substituted aromatic ring, and at 995 cm1 is due to –Cl substituted aromatic ring43. These characteristic peaks of HP were also observed in the FTIR spectrum of physical mixture of HP and GMS without any distinct shifts. This fact verified that no chemical interaction between the drug and the polymer had occurred. On the basis of drug lipid solubility and drug lipid compatibility study, GMS was selected as the lipid. The criterion for surfactant selection was its hydrophilic–lipophilic balance (HLB) value that can emulsify lipid and form the stable microemulsion in an acceptable concentration. Tween 80 with HLB of 15 was selected as the surfactant. 3.2. Evaluation of HP-SLNs 3.2.1. Particle size, zeta potential and morphology study The concentration of the surfactant (Tween 80) was optimized in order to obtain a smaller size of SLNs with maximum percent drug entrapment. The concentration of the surfactant was optimized to 1.625% w/v. The mean particle size of different batches of SLNs ranges from 115.172.78 to 156.7773.95 nm. The particle size of optimized batch (OPH) batch was appreciably lower (115.172.78 nm) compared to other batches. This is due to the addition of surfactant to solid lipid nanoparticles that causes the interfacial film to condense and stabilize44. All batches had particles in the nano range which is well evident from the values of PDI. PDI is essentially the ratio of standard deviation to the mean particle size. The value of PDI was acceptable for all batches (Table 3). On increasing the stirring time and stirring speed from 2 to 2.5 h and from 2000 to 3000 rpm (data is not shown), a decrease in the particle size was observed for all the batches; an increase in the percent of drug entrapment was also observed. On a further increase a marginal increase in particle size was observed. Hence, stirring time and stirring speed were optimized to 2.5 h and 3000 rpm, respectively. Similar findings have also been reported by Singh et al.23. Percent drug loading and percent drug entrapment efficiency of the optimized batches were found to be 26.3570.56 and 71.5670.1.56, respectively (Table 3). For the optimized batch, a dense roughly spherical pattern was observed by transmission electron microscopy (Fig. 2). The surface carried negative charges with a zeta potential of 16.7 mV when the drug-to-lipid ratio, surfactant concentration, stirring time, and stirring speed were 1:2, 1.625% (w/v), 2.5 h and 3000 rpm, respectively. 3.2.2. X-ray diffractometric analysis The X-ray defraction (XRD) pattern of HP showed sharp peaks at 2θ-scattered angles at 15.51 and 20.51, indicating the highly crystalline nature of the drug. The XRD pattern of GMS showed a peak at about 201, indicating the crystalline nature of the lipid. The principal peak of HP is absent in SLN XRD spectra. Furthermore, the principal peak of lipid did not shift but had a reduced intensity as compared to free lipid. This may be attributed to the incorporation of HP between the parts of the crystal lattice of the lipid, leading to a change in the crystallinity of the HP-SLNs (Fig. 3). 3.2.3. Differential scanning calorimetry The DSC thermogram of HP showed a melting peak of 151.895 1C while GMS and optimized HP-SLNs showed at 60.376 1C and 55.856 1C, respectively (Fig. 4). The thermogram of SLNs did not show the melting peak of crystalline haloperidol around 151.895 1C, indicating that the drug was completely solubilized inside the lipid matrix and was in the amorphous form. The melting peak of GMS in SLNs was decreased by 4.52 1C, suggesting that GMS in SLNs might be in crystalline form. The decrease in the melting point of SLNs loaded with haloperidol was due to their small particles size that lead to high surface energy, creating an energetically suboptimal state as described by the Thomson equation45. 3.2.4. In vitro release and release kinetics studies For the optimized batch, release from 10.9872.96% to 94.1674.78% was obtained as the drug slowly diffused through the lipid core (Fig. 5a). The drug release data was fitted into zeroorder, first-order and Higuchi kinetics models22. For the optimized batch, the highest value of the correlation coefficient (R2 ¼0.9941) was observed for Higuchi's model, followed by the first-order (R2 ¼0.9894) and zero order (R2 ¼0.8842) models, as shown in Fig. 5. 3.2.5. Stability studies No significant change was observed in particle size when they were stored at 472 1C (refrigerator) and 2572 1C/6075% RH, but the size of particles increased when the they were stored at 4072 1C/7575% RH due to aggregation (Po0.05, Table 4). Zeta potential plays an important role in physical stability. There was no significant change between 472 1C (refrigerator) and 2572 1C/6075% RH, but zeta potential dropped at 4072 1C/7575% RH (Po0.05). This might be due to dissolution of the coating of lipid which leads to aggregation of particles. 3.2.6. Pharmacokinetics studies The HP concentrations in brain following the i.n. administration of HP-SLNs were found to be significantly higher at all the time points as compared to both HP sol. i.n. and HP sol. i.v. (Po0.05). The haloperidol concentration in plasma following the i.n. of HPSLNs was found to be significantly lower at all the time points compared to HP sol. i.v. administration (Po0.05, Table 5). Fig. 6 shows the drug concentration versus time profile of HP in blood and brain after (a)HP- SLNs i.n., (b) HP sol. i.n., and (c) HP sol. i.v. Various pharmacokinetic parameters of HP were calculated by using PK Functions for Microsoft Excel (Pharsight Corporation, Mountain View, CA, US) as shown in Table 5. The lower value of Tmax for brain (2 h) as compared to blood (4 h) may be attributed to the preferential nose to brain transport following i.n. administration. The values of Cmax and AUC of brain for HP sol. i.n., HP sol. i.v. and HP- SLNs i.n. were compared, the value of Cmax (329.17720.89 ng/mL) and AUC0–1 (2389.17778.82 ng  h/mL) of HP-SLNs were found to be significantly higher than HP sol. (i.n. and i.v.) because of the direct transport of drug through olfactory route by bypassing the BBB. The value of AUC0–1 in brain for HP-SLNs i.n. was found to be nearly 4.77 times higher than that of HP sol. i.v., whereas 3.49 times higher than HP sol. i.n. This result reveals that drug uptake into the brain from the nasal mucosa mainly occurs via two different pathways. One is the systemic pathway by which some of the drug is absorbed into the systemic circulation and subsequently reaches the brain by crossing the BBB. The other is the olfactory pathway by which the drug partly travels from the nasal cavity to CSF and/or brain tissue46,47. The DTE% and DTP% represent the percentage of drug directly transported to the brain via the olfactory pathway. The higher DTE (2362.43%) and DTP (95.77%) were found with HP- SLNs (Table 6). Higher DTE (%) and DTP (%) suggest that HP-SLNs have better brain targeting efficiency. Similar types of results have also been reported by Zhang et al.48. 4. Conclusions The present research work proposed a lipid nanoparticulate drug delivery system (SLNs) for intranasal delivery of HP. SLNs were prepared by the modified emulsification–diffusion technique and evaluated for particle size, particle size distribution (PDI), zeta potential, entrapment efficiency, in vitro release and stability studies. All measurements were found to be in an acceptable range. In vitro drug release was found to be 94.1474.78% over 24 h, indicating a controlled and sustained release profile of HP-SLNs. Pharmacokinetics studies were performed on Wistar rats, in which the DTE (%) and DTP (%) are more indicative of direct nose to brain transport bypassing the BBB thereby representing the superiority of HP-SLNs over HP sol. i.n. and i.v. It was concluded that HP-SLNs could be an effective drug delivery system for the treatment of psychiatric conditions like schizophrenia via nose to brain route. However, clinical data is still needed to evaluate the risk/benefit ratio.	Mohd Yasira,b,n , Udai Vir Singh Sara
7	2019	Successful oral delivery of poorly water-soluble drugs both depends on the intraluminal behavior of drugs and of appropriate advanced drug delivery systems	ABSTRACT Poorly water-soluble drugs continue to be a problematic, yet important class of pharmaceutical compounds for treatment of a wide range of diseases. Their prevalence in discovery is still high, and their development is usually limited by our lack of a complete understanding of how the complex chemical, physiological and biochemical processes that occur between administration and absorption individually and together impact on bioavailability. This review defines the challenge presented by these drugs, outlines contemporary strategies to solve this challenge, and consequent in silico and in vitro evaluation of the delivery technologies for poorly water-soluble drugs. The next steps and unmet needs are proposed to present a roadmap for future studies for the field to consider enabling progress in delivery of poorly water-soluble compounds. 1. Introduction Poorly water-soluble drugs present ongoing challenges with their translation into viable medicinal products. The hurdles to their successful oral delivery are a complex web of physical-chemical, biological, physiological and anatomical factors that act independently and in concert to limit drug bioavailability. The actions of the mechanical and environmental conditions on the initial dose form is reasonably well characterized – disintegration or rupture of dose forms is rather well understood principally from imaging and other studies (Hens et al., 2017a). However, it is the processing of drug after it is unveiled from the dosage form that is incompletely understood. The solid-state characteristics of the drug and transformations between different states in the gastrointestinal environment are not easily assessed in complex dynamic environments. The more recent trends toward amorphous high energy forms of drug presents a problem of unpredictable crystallization with consequences for solubilization and bioavailability. The tendency toward crystallization can be anticipated, however the complex media of the gastrointestinal tract installs a level of uncertainty around this. The response of excipients to the complex digestive environment of the gut through changes in solubility, degradation by lipases, proteases and other enzymes is individual-dependent, and the consequent interaction of dissolving drug with those components is not yet completely predictable. The gut also responds specifically and individually to the nature of the excipients, further complicating the gastric phase of delivery (Ladas et al., 1984). In the case of lipid formulations, drug precipitation on dilution and digestion is an ever-present risk. Digestion of the lipids in the formulation by lipases induces self-assembled colloid formation, and we do not yet know the cascade of structures and specific interactions with poorly soluble drugs that can help or hinder bioavailability as a consequence. Even when the drug is completely dissolved in the remnants of the formulation and ready for absorption, biochemical and post absorption factors usually conspire to further limit bioavailability but may in some cases help by promoting e.g. lymphatic transport (Porter et al., 2007). In consideration of this multi-facetted problem, there is a need to approach this problem from an interdisciplinary standpoint. For decades, pieces of this puzzle have been tackled somewhat in isolation by research groups – while great advances have been made in specific areas, there is no globally unifying approach to bring these findings together to present ways to tackle such problematic drugs in a holistic manner. We may never get there, but by bringing together multidisciplinary clusters to work at the interfaces between groups, we provide the best opportunity of learning how to address these multiple barriers through new delivery technologies, diagnostic approaches and analytical advances. With this principle in mind, the recently formed European Network on Understanding Gastrointestinal Absorption-related Processes (UNGAP), funded under COST action CA16205, are aiming to advance the field of intestinal drug absorption through a multidisciplinary internationally collaborative approach. Two of the four major challenges they have defined relate to poorly water-soluble drugs, namely the intraluminal behavior of advanced formulations (usually required for the effective delivery of poorly water-soluble drugs), and the food-drug interface, which is crucial in consideration of the often lipophilic nature of such compounds. The purpose therefore of this review is to share the current state of knowledge around the issues, approaches and requirements for future developments in the field as seen by this multidisciplinary team. For the team, this enables definition of both a foundation and roadmap to impact across these challenges, a large initial part being to share a common language, terminology and understanding of needs in the field. For the general reader, this review collates current thinking from this diverse group of researchers, united in the goal to advance the delivery field around poorly water-soluble drugs. The review defines the challenge presented by these drugs, outlines contemporary strategies to solve this challenge, consequent compendial and biorelevant in vitro evaluation of the delivery technologies in order to limit the usage of animals, before moving onto defining the unmet needs and future directions for the field and for UNGAP to address. The need for consideration of new paradigms is timely with developments in not only materials for drug delivery, but also in new imaging and analytical techniques and facilities that if embraced and addressed by such a multidisciplinary approach can lead to significant gains in overcoming the limitations to formulation and delivery of problematic compounds. 2. Challenging molecules after oral administration and common formulation strategies to overcome these unfavorable compounds characteristics A large fraction of contemporary drug compounds has physicochemical properties that may result in low chemical stability in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, poor and/or variable solubility in the fasted and fed state gastrointestinal fluids and eventually poor permeation across the intestinal wall. Most of the small molecules display poor aqueous solubility and it is not uncommon that lead compounds selected during the discovery stage show solubility in the lower μg/mL region. This fact has been attributed to the chemical approaches used, the organizational factor and last but not least, the lipophilic molecular requirements of contemporary targets (Bergström et al., 2016; Keserü and Makara, 2009; Leeson and Springthorpe, 2007; Leeson and StGallay, 2011; Vieth and Sutherland, 2006). Indeed, many targets currently under exploration have highly lipophilic endogenous ligands, which is translated to the need for certain lipophilicity in the modulating drug. The impact of molecular properties on solubility, and the role of the fasted and fed state on the resulting solubility, has been explored by different computational tools; the relation between physicochemical properties and solubility is further discussed in Section 2.1. Taken together, poor solubility and permeability are significantly limiting the absorption of contemporary drugs after oral delivery. In the next section, the relationship between molecular properties and solubility/permeability will be described. 2.1. Physicochemical considerations Yalkowsky and coworkers established the General Solubility Equation (GSE) in 2001. This identifies the strong link between the solid state and the lipophilicity of the compound, and the resulting aqueous solubility (Jain and Yalkowsky, 2001): log S0 = 0.5 0.01( 25) T logP m (1) where S0 is the intrinsic solubility, i.e. the solubility of the non-ionized (neutral) species, Tm is the melting point (°C) and logP is the partition coefficient between octanol and water. Wassvik et al. used the GSE and hypothetical values for melting point (Tm of 50, 150 and 250 °C) and the lipophilicity (logP of 2, 4 and 6) to separate compounds that are mainly limited by the solid state, from those limited by their poor solvation (Wassvik et al., 2008). Compounds with a strong crystal lattice often show a limited capacity to dissociate from the solid form and these are commonly referred to as ‘brick dust’ molecules. In a similar way, a logP cut-off of 3 has been put forward as an indicator of significantly reduced interaction with aqueous solvents (Bergström et al., 2016). Compounds with a logP > 3 are commonly referred to as ‘grease ball’ molecules. It should be noted that, for ionizable compounds, it is the corresponding logD value (at the pH of interest) that should be greater than the logP cut-off value (Fagerberg and Bergström, 2015). In addition to these, there are compounds that display both high logP and high melting point, i.e. they are both solid state and solvation limited in the solubility. Computational modelling of several dataset has linked molecular properties to solid-state- versus solvation-limited solubility (Bergström et al., 2007; Fagerberg et al., 2010; Wassvik et al., 2008; Zaki et al., 2010). Solvation-limited compounds are lipophilic, relatively large molecules, and lack conjugated systems. In contrast, common features for solid-state-limited compounds are flatness, extended ring structures and high aromaticity. In addition to modelling of solubility in pure water or simple buffers, models to identify solubility in more complex solvents such as intestinal fluids have been developed (Fagerberg et al., 2015). In these studies, size and aromaticity were negatively linked to the solubility, whereas the hydrogen bond capacity (donors and acceptors) was a positive factor for solubility. It is well-known that lipophilicity is positively linked to permeation. However, there is also a trade-off when it comes to lipophilicity; too lipophilic compounds may strongly favor the lipid-rich environment to an extent at which its permeation across the lipid bilayer becomes limited. Negatively linked properties to permeation are size and polarity, the latter typically being described as polar surface area, or hydrogen bond donors and acceptors (Palm et al., 1997; Veber et al., 2002). The polarity limitation significantly reduces the permeation of small, hydrophilic molecules and these eventually make use of different active transporters or they permeate the intestinal wall via the paracellular route. To further improve the permeability of such compounds, chemical modifications may be used to change the physicochemical properties. A common strategy to apply is to develop prodrugs which either block polar groups and increase the lipophilicity of the molecule, and hence increase the transcellular passive diffusion across the enterocytes or couple a handle ‘visible’ to active transporters (Murakami, B.J. Boyd, et al. European Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences 137 (2019) 104967 2 2016; Wang et al., 1999). From a formulation perspective, permeability enhancers may be added to increase the flux through the paracellular route (Anderberg et al., 1993; Lindmark et al., 1995). This is especially relevant for macromolecules, where the size and polarity result in a limited permeation. Also, for such compounds chemical modifications can be used to increase the membrane permeability with the main focus being to reduce the polarity. One successful strategy is to design molecules with capacity to form intramolecular hydrogen bonds. This enables the compound to display the hydrogen bond donors and acceptors to the water phase in the intestine and thereby increasing the water solubility, whereas the molecule shields these functions from the lipid bilayer through internal bond formation when it encounters the lipid environment and thereby increases the permeation through the cellular membrane (Rossi Sebastiano et al., 2018). 2.2. Solubility and dissolution rate enhancement Insufficient aqueous solubility compared to the dose that needs to be administered (dose number D0 > 1, Biopharmaceutic Classification System (BCS)) is one of the most frequently encountered problems for drug substance formulation. The low equilibrium solubility leads to very slow drug dissolution rate and poor intestinal absorption. The current formulation strategies to overcome these issues can be separated in two major categories: (1) methods that increase the apparent equilibrium drug solubility and the dissolution rate, and (2) techniques that increase the dissolution rate and facilitate the formation of metastable supersaturated drug solutions. Of course, sophisticated techniques that combine the properties of (1) and (2) also exist (e.g. salts + precipitation inhibitors, some lipid-based formulations). An important aspect of solubility is the distinction between apparent drug solubility (e.g. drug solubilized in micelles, liposomes, cyclodextrins etc.) and molecularly soluble “free” drug (i.e. in supersaturated solutions). The implications of the latter on drug permeability and absorption are discussed in detail in Section 5.4. In the next paragraphs, the main concept, application scope, advantages and limitations of the techniques that are widely used to enhance drug solubility in the context of oral delivery (pharmaceutical salts) or are emerging as enabling technologies (amorphous solid dispersions, lipid-based formulations) will be shortly described, including example cases where appropriate. The drug solubilization by surfactants will also be briefly outlined, due to the wide spread use of this family of excipients in both standard and advanced formulations. Approaches with limited application in the context of oral delivery (e.g. co-solvents, polymeric micelles, liposomes), or which have been recently reviewed (cyclodextrins (Adeoye and Cabral-Marques, 2017) will be omitted from the current discussion). Although particle size reduction techniques increase the dissolution rate, their effect is limited for drugs with very poor equilibrium solubility in water. Hence, they find application only in combination with other solubility enhancement approaches and will not be described separately. The lipid-based drug delivery systems and their central role as enabling formulations for the oral route are presented at the end of the section. The presented technologies may be used as (pre)clinical formulations or intermediate oral products. These are clearly emerging systems for oral delivery of poorly water-soluble drugs. 2.2.1. Salt formation The solubility and dissolution rate of ionizable drugs can be improved significantly by preparing their respective salts. Due to the simplicity and cost-efficiency of the concept, it has been extensively used both for oral and parenteral delivery (Paulekuhn et al., 2007). The major advantage of the method is that it can provide considerable increase of solubility (often by > 3 orders of magnitude (Elder et al., 2013)) and dissolution rate without the need to chemically modify the drug molecule or to use complex enabling formulations. In order to have a complete proton transfer and, hence, obtain a salt, a difference of 2–3 units between the pKa of the counterion and the pKa of the drug is required (Berry and Steed, 2017). Drug molecules with more than one ionization moiety display more complex behavior, due to the polyprotic and polybasic equilibria (Maurin et al., 2002). In this case, whether the mono- or poly-salts are preferred for development has to be decided depending on their solubility properties, stability, scalability etc. The solubility of the salt can depend significantly on the type of counterion and should be directly linked to parameters such as the crystal lattice free energy and the hydration free energies of the ions (Anderson and Flora, 1996). However, there are still no approaches that allow its accurate prediction. For example, the type of structurally similar organic acids (tartaric, succinic, lactic, acetic) had no significant effect on the solubility of the weak base avitriptan (Serajuddin, 2002), whereas for diclofenac the addition of one OH-group to the tert-butylamine counterion increased the salt solubility 4-fold (O'Connor and Corrigan, 2001). Furthermore, using a tertiary amine (2-dimethylaminoethanol) as a diclofenac salt forming agent resulted in a > 80-fold increase of the salt solubility, compared to the tert-butylamine salt. Another important parameter of a salt that has to be considered, especially in the context of oral delivery, is the pHmax: the pH value at which the maximum solubility of the drug is obtained. This parameter is critical, as it governs the conversion of the ionized form to its conjugate free base or free acid and, hence, the precipitation behavior in the gastrointestinal tract. The higher the pHmax of a basic drug (or the lower, for an acidic drug), the easier the formation of a salt is, and the better its stability to conversion to the non-ionized form. The magnitude of the pHmax for a basic drug can be assessed by Bogardus and Blackwood (1979): pH pK = + S K log a sp max 0 (2) where pKa is the ionization constant of the drug, S0 is the intrinsic solubility of the non-ionized form of the drug and Ksp is the solubility product of the salt. Therefore, for a basic drug, the pHmax increases with the increase of the strength of the base (higher pKa), with the increase of the solubility of the base (S0) and with the decrease in salt solubility (Ksp). A similar equation, which shows that for an acidic drug pHmax decreases with the increase of S0 and with the decrease of pKa and Ksp can also be written. The solubility product of the salt is important not only because it characterizes its solubility and influences the pHmax, but also in relation to the common ion effect that can dramatically reduce salt solubility in biorelevant conditions. In particular, the solubility of hydrochloride salts of basic drugs can be significantly decreased in the stomach, due to the high concentration chloride anions via the following equation: S = K C ion sp CI (3) where the Sion is the solubility of the drug in its ionized form and CCI is the counterion concentration. The latter leads to the counterintuitive effect of decreased solubility when the pH is significantly lower than the pHmax for basic drugs. Note that the common ion effect in stomach conditions should be considered not only when hydrochloric acid is used for salt preparation, but also when weaker acids (e.g. organic) are used, as these salts could be transformed to the respective hydrochloride salt in situ in the stomach. A pronounced effect can also be expected when the solubility of the salt is in the low-millimolar range, i.e. for drugs with extremely poor water solubility and low solubility enhancement. A major issue with the application of salts in oral delivery is their behavior in biorelevant conditions. If the pHmax is not in the range of physiological pH values, precipitation can occur. This is usually the case for acidic drugs in the stomach and basic drugs in the intestine. However, the quick redissolution of the precipitate (phase-separated drug) normally facilitates significantly higher oral absorption, B.J. Boyd, et al. European Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences 137 (2019) 104967 3 compared to the non-ionized form. The mechanisms that account for the quick redissolution include high surface are of the precipitate (e.g. Phenytoin sodium (Dill et al., 1956; Serajuddin and Jarowski, 1993)) and formation of non-equilibrium metastable states with high thermodynamic activity (e.g. emulsion of supercooled melt droplets of diclofenac sodium (Stahl and Nakano, 2002) or amorphous gel formation (Serajuddin, 2007)). During the selection of a pharmaceutical salt for development, a number of additional factors such as solid-state properties (Raumer et al., 2006), stability (Nie et al., 2017; Stephenson et al., 2011) and toxicity (Stahl and Wermuth, 2008) should also be considered in detail. The solubility of the salt and pHmax are not always the main determinants in selection, as scalability and stability during processing (e.g. deliquescence, amorphization, disproportionation) might prevent manufacturing of the salt and could warrant the selection of a salt with lower solubility, but better stability, or the use of the non-ionized form (Korn and Balbach, 2014).  phase-separated amorphous celecoxib fraction, followed by a significant decrease in the AUC at 60% amorphous fraction. Hence, the obtained results suggested that the partial transformation of an amorphous drug to crystalline state or phase-separate amorphous domains will not have significant effect on the in vivo exposure. One should stress, however, that an important aspect of the ASD techniques is the time window of sustained supersaturation, which drives drug absorption and bioavailability. The rate of precipitation and the possible approaches to kinetically trap the system in this thermodynamically unstable state will be discussed in Section 2.3., as well as the supersaturation advantage if amorphous precipitate is formed (Section 2.4).   Tween 20 micelles were determined by 1H DOSY. Reproduced from Vinarov et al.

The solubility enhancement was maintained also in presence of bile salts (FaSSIF) for both studied phospholipid types, which indicated that they have good stability in biorelevant media. However, no significant difference was observed in the rate of permeation in a side-by-side setup, which indicated that the process was controlled by the concentration of free drug and not the apparent drug solubility. 2.2.4. Lipid-based formulations The formulation of drugs in a lipid carrier system composed glycerides, surfactants and co-solvents has attracted significant attention due to the markedly increased drug oral bioavailability (Porter et al., 2007). Apart from the solubility enhancement effect, the mechanism of improved bioavailability of lipid-based formulations (LBF) is attributed also to increased intestinal absorption via supersaturation (Gao and Morozowich, 2006) and reduced first-pass effect via lymphatic transport (Trevaskis et al., 2008). LBF are primarily applied for BCS Class II and Class IV drug substances, which are characterized by solubility-limited absorption. The lipid formulation classification system (LFCS) separates LBF in 4 main types, depending on LBF composition, see Table 1 (Pouton, 2006). Each type is characterized by a set of advantages and drawbacks. For example, the glyceride-rich types 1 and 2 usually have poor drug solvent capacity but are unlikely to lose that solvency upon dispersion in the intestinal fluids, whereas the solvent- and surfactant-rich LBF types III and IV can dissolve higher drug concentrations but suffer from significant phase changes and potential drug precipitation upon dispersion. One aspect of LBF is that a significant fraction of the surfactants used may be digestible, which should be considered during formulation development (Vithani et al., 2017). The different formulation strategies and the materials used are described in detail in several dedicated reviews (Hauss, 2007; Pouton and Porter, 2008). However, as the oral absorption depends on the intestinal concentration of dissolved drug, another LBF classification related to formulation performance has been proposed (Williams et al., 2014b). The latter groups LBF into four grades (A, B, C and D) where grade A provides the most robust solubility enhancement after dispersion and digestion, whereas drug precipitation is expected with increasing complex. The reason is that on one side, the LBF carries a significant diversity in its chemical composition: main lipid or lipid mixtures, cosolvents, surfactant mixtures, drug load. On the other hand, a timedependent structural complexity is observed after dilution in the GI fluids. For example, the drug can reside in different colloid species (micelles, vesicles, emulsion droplets), it can precipitate in a crystal or amorphous state, it can form a meta-stable supersaturated solution, or a combination of the above (which is usually the case). A good illustration of the interplay between the excipients used for LBF formulation, solubility enhancement, precipitation and solid-state properties is provided in the recent publication by Khan et al. (Khan et al., 2018). The authors showed that the solid-state properties of a tolfenamic acid precipitate during an in vitro digestion assay of a LBF depend on its composition: an amorphous precipitate, linked to significantly higher solubility and supersaturation was obtained when a cationic surfactant was present in the LBF. Even more importantly, the mechanism of amorphization was related to the formation of an ionic liquid-type of associated between the oppositely charged drug and surfactant molecule, which demonstrates the multifaceted behavior of the system, see Fig. 3. Therefore, an in-depth characterization of the behavior of LBF by in vitro dispersion and digestion methods, as well as by in vivo studies, in combination with the corresponding analytical techniques is required (Larsen et al., 2011; Jørgensen et al., 2018; Williams et al., 2012b). The latter have led to improved understanding of the system, which is used to guide the formulation optimization, as described in detail by Feeney et al. in a recent review (Feeney et al., 2016). There are at least two drawbacks of LBF that need to consider in drug development. The first one is related to the problems with low drug loading in the LBF matrix, especially for brick dust molecules (e.g. itraconazole) that are characterized by low aqueous and lipid solubility. This challenge could be addressed by the hydrophobic ionic liquids concept, as shown by Williams et al. for itraconazole and danazol, which were dissolved in nicotinic acid-based ionic liquids and formulated as LBFs (Williams et al., 2014a). The other issue is related to the in vitro-in vivo correlation: as described in Section 5.2, the type of in vitro experiment and the media should be carefully selected in order to obtain good IVIVC. An industrial perspective on the current challenges in LBF development, such as oxidation stability of the drug, capsule compatibility, solidification of LBFs and others, is presented in the recent review by Holm (2019). 2.3. Avoidance of precipitation Most of solubility enhancement techniques provide an increase in the apparent drug solubility by incorporation of drug molecules into nano-sized structures, such as mixed micelles, liposomes, and molecular inclusion complexes, or by using complex lipid vehicles (LBF). However, once the formulation enters the GI tract, it is diluted and encounters a complex environment of pH changes, hydrolytic enzymes and bile salts. The latter usually results in rapid loss of the solubilization capacity of the formulation and formation of a supersaturated metastable drug solution (Gao and Morozowich, 2006; Jannin, 2018). Supersaturated drug solutions can also be obtained when solid drug in ASD or cocrystal form is dispersed in the GI fluids (Frank et al., 2012a, b; Taylor and Zhang, 2016). The main characteristic of supersaturated solutions is the higher chemical potential of the drug molecules, compared to solutions at or below the equilibrium solubility. This feature can significantly increase the drug flux across the intestinal wall due to the higher concentration and the chemical potential gradient, thus increasing oral drug absorption (Anby et al., 2012; Gao and Morozowich, 2006; Taylor and Zhang, 2016). On the other hand, supersaturation can also cause drug precipitation (Mohsin et al., 2009) until the equilibrium solubility (determined with respect to the stable crystal form of the drug, see Section 4.1.) is reached. However, as long as the intestinal rate of absorption is higher than the rate of precipitation, drug absorption dominates, and in vivo precipitation will be limited. In addition, if the rate of precipitation is controlled and is sufficiently slow, the supersaturation window can significantly increase drug absorption and oral bioavailability. The concept of a drug formulation that provides significant and sustained supersaturation is termed “spring and parachute” approach (Brouwers et al., 2009). The approaches to prevent precipitation by using excipients, which provide the “parachute” effect, will be briefly described below. For more information about the nature of the supersaturated systems and their applications in drug delivery, the reader is referred to recent review articles (Brouwers et al., 2009; Laitinen et al., 2017; Taylor and Zhang, 2016). There are two main approaches to avoid drug precipitation: (1) decrease the degree of supersaturation or (2) stabilize the supersaturated state by use of precipitation inhibitors. The first approach can be realized in several ways. For example, solubilizers which act as thermodynamically stable reservoirs for the drug molecules can be introduced (e.g. surfactant micelles, cyclodextrins) and some are natively present in the gut (bile salt aggregates, phospholipid vesicles) (Taylor and Zhang, 2016). Another way is to slow the drug release by using sustained-release formulations, so that a moderate supersaturation with lower drive for precipitation is maintained (Augustijns and Brewster, 2012). Such slow-release formulations may contribute an additional increase of oral bioavailability relative to their quick-release, non-precipitating counterparts (Six et al., 2005). The most widely applied strategy to maintain supersaturation is to use precipitation inhibitors, such as polymers, low molecular weight surfactants (both as solubilization enhancer and precipitation inhibitor, Chen et al., 2015) or cyclodextrins (Brouwers et al., 2009). Among these, polymers are the most frequently used and the most studied ones (Warren et al., 2010). Several mechanisms of action have been proposed to explain the action of the precipitation inhibitors, all of which are related to modification of the nucleation and/or crystal growth stages by adsorption or complexation (Laitinen et al., 2017; Warren et al., 2010). Warren et al. studied a large set of polymers to unravel the link between the polymer molecular structure and its ability to sustain supersaturated drug solutions (Warren et al., 2013). Electrostatic attraction between the oppositely charged drug and the polymer was found to significantly delay precipitation, whereas the precipitation was induced when the species were similarly charged. Enhanced precipitation was observed also for polymers which are rich in primary amine, amide, carboxylic acid, and hydroxyl functional groups. Positive  continuous medium, or explicit, i.e. each solvent is presented at a molecular level. A drawback of the implicit simulation methods is that the atomistic level is lost. On the other hand, the explicit solvation methods, which explicitly consider solvent-specific effects and solutesolvent interactions and therefore, at least theoretically, be more accurate and provide better information about solvation, is computationally costly and simulations are time consuming. This is primarily because of the high degree of freedom from the explicit solvent molecules. More information around the MDS methodologies can be found in these recent papers (Bernardi et al., 2015; Szilárd et al., 2015; Ganesan et al., 2017). Performance evaluation in the GI tract is often simplified to evaluation of dosage forms in simple water models when studied computationally. However, relative solubilization of a number of drugs has been studied making use of MDS. Holmboe et al. made simulations of the lipid structures formed by bile components (phospholipids and taurocholate) and studied the partitioning of danazol, felodipine and carbamazepine into the lipid bilayers formed. It was concluded that the relative solubilization was strongly related to the capacity of the drug molecule to form hydrogen bonds with the taurocholate (Holmboe et al., 2016). LBF is one advanced drug delivery system that has been studied by MDS with focus on dispersion and digestion of LBF. Pouton et al. have used MDS and all atom methodology to study phase changes upon dispersion and digestion and the resulting impact on solubilization. In one study they used danazol as the poorly water-soluble model compounds and solubilization capacity was simulated in response to digestion of a simple LBF (long-chain triglyceride) (Birru et al., 2017a). The simulations showed that the solubilization, and hence, the solubility, of danazol increased with increased digestion; these results were in agreement with the experimental data obtained for the same composition of digested material. In two other studies they explored how the digestion of lipids may influence the colloidal structures formed in the intestinal fluid, and to what extent cholesterol and pH influences the aggregation of intestinal lipids (Birru et al., 2017b; Suys et al., 2017). In a more recent study, the same group studied the location of probe molecules in a non-ionic surfactant (Warren et al., 2019). The micelles were composed of octaethylene glycol monododecyl ether, which has a C12 alkyl chain linked to a pegylated chain. The simulations showed that cyclic compounds were moved out from the micelle core, polar groups anchored the compounds in the micelle interface with the water and aromaticity resulted in exclusion of the compound from the micellar core. Drug localization has also been studied by Benson and Pless. They simulated mixtures of mono-, di- and triglycerides to mimic digestion and to what extent that influenced the location of the poorly water-soluble drug cyclosporine. It was shown that when the monoglyceride concentration increases the cyclosporine relocated to the core region of triglyceride moieties (Benson and Pleiss, 2014). A related study by Larsson et al. showed that the phase transitions that occur in response to dispersion of LBF in water can be reproduced using coarsegrained molecular dynamics (Larsson et al., 2017). Changing the resolution of the molecular structures from all atom to coarse grained results in that larger systems can be studied, and hence, e.g. solubilization of drug molecules can be studied under physiologically relevant conditions. In particular, relevant conditions of lipidic components (i.e. bile components and ingested lipids included in food or formulations) can be studied. Another advanced formulation strategy that has been explored with MD simulations is ASD. Xiang and Anderson have studied such systems in a series of papers, with the main focus being on the physical stability of the ASD rather than the performance upon dissolution in e.g. the GI tract. They have studied different model compounds (indomethacin, ibuprofen, felodipine and the small peptide Phe-Asn-Gly) and polymers (hydroxypropyl methyl-cellulose, hydroxypropyl methyl-cellulose acetate succinate, poly(D,L-lactide), polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyvinylpyrrolidone-co-vinyl acetate, polyvinylalcohol) (Xiang and Anderson, 2004, 2005, 2013a, b, 2014, 2019) for properties such as internal hydrogen bond pattern, water mobility, glass transition temperature, mobility and miscibility. While some of the properties did not result in quantitative values in agreement with those determined experimentally (e.g. glass transition temperature) others were in and viscosity on the drug release. The two most simple media (0 and I) are proposed for water-soluble compounds (BCS class I and III). Authors recommended the use of Level II media for the evaluation of the solubility of poorly water-soluble drugs (BCS class II and IV). Finally, the use of the most complex Level III media is proposed for enabling formulations where the composition can change overtime (e.g. LBFs) and to check the luminal stability of the drug and dosage form (Markopoulos et al. 2015). Compositions of biorelevant media selected by USP (Jantratid and Dressman, 2009; Marques, 2011) are listed in Table 3. It should be noted that the proposed USP compositions do not correspond to the biorelevant media recently reviewed by Markopoulos et al. (2015). The Level II compositions related to the USP proposed one volunteers (Fig. 4) (Brouwers et al., 2017). Using double-lumen tubes, positioned with the help of fluoroscopy, gastric and duodenal fluids were aspirated at predetermined time intervals and analyzed for (i) the total content of itraconazole (as solute and solid), (ii) itraconazole in solution, and (iii) the solubilizing capacity of the fluids for itraconazole. The obtained concentration-time profiles demonstrated that both formulations generated intraluminal itraconazole concentrations that substantially exceeded the solubilizing capacity of the fluids (i.e., supersaturation), thereby enabling absorption. Compared to the solid dispersion, intake of the cyclodextrin-based solution resulted in a much higher dissolved fraction of itraconazole in the duodenum, explaining the improved absorption seen in the simultaneously assessed systemic concentration-time profiles (Fig. 4). The gastrointestinal concentration-time profiles of poorly watersoluble drugs in humans may act as excellent reference data to optimize in vitro and in silico simulation tools. For instance, data on the intestinal precipitation of posaconazole in humans have been used to validate a physiologically based pharmacokinetic model for drug dissolution, supersaturation and precipitation (Hens et al., 2017b). Also, the value of the Biorelevant Gastrointestinal Transfer (BioGIT) system to predict the dissolved fraction of posaconazole and itraconazole in the upper small intestine has been confirmed by comparison with intestinal concentration-time profiles obtained in humans (Kourentas et al., 2016b). The simultaneous assessment of gastrointestinal and systemic concentrations further helps to identify the factors and processes critical for absorption. For instance, intestinal concentrations of itraconazole after intake of the above-mentioned cyclodextrin-based solution were substantially reduced by the intake of additional water (Berben et al., 2017). However, the systemic exposure to itraconazole was not affected by water intake. Without water intake, the cyclodextrins present in the formulation were less diluted and stronger higher-order inclusion complexes were formed with itraconazole in the small intestine, thereby reducing precipitation and increasing concentrations. However, these stronger complexes also reduced the apparent permeability of the intestinal mucosa for itraconazole (entrapment), as was demonstrated by determining the permeation of itraconazole from the aspirated fluids across Caco-2 monolayers. This illustration of the interplay between solubility and permeability in the human gastrointestinal tract stresses the need to implement permeation testing into formulation evaluation when working with solubilizing approaches. As such, these observations stimulated the further development of cell-free permeation tools than can be easily implemented into traditional dissolution testing (Berben et al., 2018a; Berben et al., 2018b). Overall, the profiling of drug concentrations in the upper gastrointestinal tract provides a unique insight into the processes underlying intestinal drug absorption. The added value of this approach for drug development primarily lies in guiding the physiologically-based optimization of in vitro and in silico simulation tools. To this end, it is critical to link the observed intraluminal drug behavior to important gastrointestinal variables. Using the aspiration approach, these variables are limited to the composition of the fluids (pH, bile salts, phospholipids, food (digestion) products). Therefore, advanced approaches are being explored to monitor additional gastrointestinal variables in parallel. In this respect, recent advances in combining fluid aspiration with manometry to monitor gastrointestinal motility (Bermejo et al., 2018; van den Abeele et al., 2017a) offer new opportunities to fully elucidate the interaction between drug products and the gastrointestinal environment. For obvious ethical reasons, gastrointestinal aspiration studies can only be performed in healthy adults, and not in specific patient populations including pediatric and geriatric patients. Making the in vitro and in silico simulation of gastrointestinal drug behavior also relevant for special populations is currently a major challenge. To this end, it is essential to use patient data to characterize the gastrointestinal physiology in these populations, as has been done recently with respect to gastric fluid composition in neonates, infants and children (van den Abeele et al., 2018). Based on such data, the sensitivity of the drug product behavior to relevant population-dependent deviations in gastrointestinal physiology can then be evaluated in simulation tools. 5.2. In vitro digestion evaluation Ingestion of lipids induces a two-way interaction between the formulation and the GI tract. On one hand, lipids are digested by various Fig. 4.

European Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences 137 (2019) 104967 13 lipases secreted by the stomach and the pancreas to transform lipophilic compounds into more hydrophilic ones (N'Goma et al., 2012). The modification of the chemical composition of the lipids – even lipidbased surfactants that are esters of synthetic polymers such as polyethylene-glycols can be digested (Fernandez et al., 2007; Fernandez et al., 2008) - also affects their colloidal structures and favors the formation of mixed vesicles, lamellar phases and micelles (Chamieh et al., 2017; Fernandez et al., 2013; Müllertz et al., 2015; Vithani et al., 2017; Vithani et al., 2019). On the other hand, the presence of lipids will modify the gastrointestinal physiology by slowing down the gastric emptying, stimulating the synthesis and secretion of bile, and the secretion of pancreatic juice. All these events can affect the intraluminal performance of LBFs and their ability to solubilize the drugs in colloidal structures (Feeney et al., 2016). To better anticipate the effect of lipolysis on the performance of lipid containing drug delivery systems, a digestion test has been proposed using a pH-stat apparatus. This device has been used by the food and biochemical fields for decades and was transposed to the pharmaceutical field in the last two decades. Lipids or LBF can be dispersed in a lipolysis medium mimicking the gastric or intraluminal content with lipases to start the lipolysis of ester-based compounds. The release of fatty acids by lipases can decrease the pH of the medium depending on their pKa and the pH-stat apparatus allows maintaining the pH constant by addition of sodium hydroxide with an automated burette (Bakala-N'Goma et al., 2015). Various lipolysis media compositions and operating conditions have been described in the literature to either mimic the fasted (Sassene et al., 2010) or fed (Fernandez et al., 2009) state human GI conditions. An international LFCS consortium proposed a standardized and validated test using the pH-stat apparatus to study the lipolysis of LBFs in the small intestine (Williams et al., 2012b). They described the composition of the lipolysis medium to mimic the fasted duodenal conditions in term of calcium and pancreatin (lipases) concentration (Sassene et al., 2014), as well as the type and concentration of bile salts (Williams et al., 2012a). Another harmonized test has been proposed by the COST action INFOGEST for the food industry with a three steps lipolysis protocol – oral (mouth), gastric and intestinal phase (Minekus et al., 2014). This static in vitro simulation of gastrointestinal food digestion has been recently amended and improved by the inclusion of gastric lipase during the gastric step (Brodkorb et al., 2019). Indeed, this improvement has been made possible by the recent commercial availability of gastric lipase in rabbit gastric extract (since 2018) and the validation of the utility of this extract to mimic the human gastric digestion phase of both lipids and proteins (Capolino et al., 2011; Sams et al., 2018). An update of the LFCS protocol for the evaluation of LBFs has not yet been proposed. However, the behavior of LBFs in fed conditions is highly relevant as the increased pH in the stomach will favor the action of the gastric lipase and preduodenal digestion of the formulation with potential precipitation of the drug. This would lead to a decreased amount of solubilized drug reaching the small intestine and could preclude its absorption. The lipolysis test is mainly currently used to evaluate the ability of  drug is needed. 4) Free drug concentrations evolving after dispersion of the respective drug formulation in biorelevant set-ups, possibly including lipolysis for LBFs, may be quantified by dialysis methods. However, a permeation experiment from such formulation dispersion may in a pragmatic way include the concept of free drug concentration within the permeation assay. 5) Such approach according to steps 1) to 3) still does not take into account the dynamic changes occurring during the GI passage of oral dosage forms, including dilution, changes of composition of the digestive fluids, concentration changes due to absorption or metabolism, etc. Combined dissolution/permeation approaches may provide an experimental access to mimic such changes. 6) For detailed mechanistic studies, the investigation of the kinetics of all the above named inter-related processes should take into account, including the active transport, metabolism etc. The models will become increasingly complex according to increasing need for better understanding and better modelling. Therefore, for the time being, animal experiments are still needed to validate the intraluminal behavior of drug from advanced drug delivery	Ben J.

8	2019	Non-small cell lung cancer-targeted, redox-sensitive lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles for the delivery of a second-generation irreversible epidermal growth factor inhibitor—Afatinib: In vitro and in vivo evaluation	ABSTRACT Afatinib (Afa), a second-generation irreversible epidermal growth factor inhibitor for the development of nonsmall cell lung cancer, has low bioavailability and adverse reactions. Nanoscaled drug delivery systems offer promising alternatives to address these defects and improve therapeutic outcomes. In the present study, a Tf contained, redox-sensitive ligand was synthesized and used for the preparation of afatinib loaded, Tf modified redox-sensitive lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles (Tf-SS-Afa-LPNs). Subsequently, studies of biological experiments in vitro and in vivo were performed to investigate the therapeutic effect of the system in lung cancer. The results showed that Tf-SS-Afa-LPNs has particle size of 103.5 ± 4.1 nm and zeta potential of -21.2 ± 2.4 mV. Significantly higher drug release was observed in the presence of glutathione (GSH). The area under the plasma concentration – time curve (AUC), peak concentration (Cmax) and terminal half life (T1/2) of TfSS-Afa-LPNs were 866.56 mg/L.h, 25.62 ± 3.21 L/kg/h, and 43.25 ± 2.31 h. Tf-SS-Afa-LPNs exhibited the most remarkable in vivo anti-tumor efficiency efficacy, which inhibited the tumor volume from 919 mm3 to 212 mm3  1. Introduction Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide [1,2]. Among all cancer cases, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 85% [3]. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations and tumor metastases in patients with NSCLC are different in population and depend on whether it is in Europe, America or the Far East [4–6]. The response to therapy is complex and that toxicity may depend on the type of drug but also on variations in EGFR, ie EGFR polymorphism, and this is important in relation to individual therapy [7]. Advanced NSCLC with EGFR mutations has been successfully treated with several tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) [8]. Afatinib is one of the EGFR TKIs that was approved by US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) as the first line therapy in patients with advanced NSCLC who have an EGFR mutation [9,10]. Compared with first-generation TKIs, second-generation TKI afatinib can improve the prognosis of some NSCLC patients [11]. Although therapeutic activity of afatinib has been demonstrated in clinical trials, an effective method to control adverse reactions and the potential drug risk is lacking [12]. For example, the lack of effective methods to control adverse reactions (such as diarrhea) and potential drug risks such as high affinity to hemoglobin increases the risk of specific drug reactions. Nanoscaled drug delivery systems offer promising alternatives to address these defects and improve therapeutic outcomes [13]. The nano-systems may impart additional capabilities including controlled release of the drug by responding to environmental stimuli (eg, pH or reduction) under tumor microenvironment and improved antitumor activity [14]. It was reported that the cellular glutathione (GSH) levels in solid tumors are much higher than in normal cells [15], and also higher concentration of GSH in many tumors has been reported to be than that of normal tissues [16]. Thus redox-responsive nanoparticles are mostly intended to release drugs in the tumor site in which the concentration of glutathione (GSH) is higher than in the plasma [17]. In   addition, the tumor-targeted delivery of drugs can be achieved by utilizing special molecules on the surface of nanoparticles to bind with the receptors on the surface of tumor cells [18]. Tumor cells often express significantly higher levels of surface receptors compared with normal cells, of which the transferrin receptor (TfR) is overexpressed in a broad spectrum of human cancer cells including lung cancer [19]. Transferrin (Tf) is an 80 kDa glycoprotein and the ligand for TfR, which has low immunogenicity as a human protein [20]. Tf is selected as targeting ligand due to its possibility to conjugate with a variety of functional moieties and can be utilized for targeting drug delivery [21]. Among various kinds of nano-systems, lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles (LPNs) combine the advantages of both polymeric nanoparticles and lipid nanoparticles into one novel drug delivery platform [22]. LPNs usually consist of a biodegradable polymeric hydrophobic core and an outer shell made of lipid or lipid-ligand [23]. LPNs could bring the drugs some advantages such as physical stability and biocompatibility; controlled drug release; reduced systemic toxicity and enhanced anticancer efficacy [24]. In the present study, a Tf contained, redox-sensitive ligand was synthesized and used for the preparation of LPNs. This system was expected to increase the efficiency and selectivity of delivery to lung cancer cells and tumor bearing mice. 2. Material and methods 2.1. Materials Cholesterol-PEG-COOH (Mw 2000) was obtained from Hangzhou Langxing Biotechnology Co., Ltd. Transferrin, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC), N-Hydroxysuccinimide (NHS), afatinib, acetonitrile, 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT), and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA, 50:50, Mw 7000–10000) was obtained from Shanghai Yuanye biotechnology Co., Ltd. 2.2. Synthesis of Tf contained, redox-sensitive ligand Cholesterol-PEG-SS-Transferrin (Cho-PEG-SS-Tf) was synthesized by conjugating cholesterol-PEG and transferrin with cystamine (Fig. 1) [25,26]. Cholesterol-PEG-COOH (1 equivalent), EDC (1.2 equivalents) and NHS (1.2 equivalents) were dissolved with DMSO and stirred for 1 h. Cystamine (1 equivalent) was added to Cholesterol-PEG-COOH solution under continuous stirring for 10 h to get Cholesterol-PEG-Cystamine (Cho-PEG-SS). Transferrin (1 equivalent), EDC (1.2 equivalents) and NHS (1.2 equivalents) were dissolved in DMSO, and ChoPEG-SS was added dropwise to the transferrin solution under continuous stirring for 10 h to form Cho-PEG-SS-Tf. Cho-PEG-SS-Tf solution was then sealed into a dialysis bag (molecular weight cut-off of 3500 Da) and dialyzed against excess water for 3 days to remove DMSO. The product was dried under vacuum to a constant weight and the structure of Cho-PEG-SS-Tf was analyzed by 1 H-NMR after dissolving in DMSO-d6. The 1 H-NMR spectrum was presented in Fig. 2 and marked in accordance with the Cho-PEG-SS-Tf structure. 2.3. Preparation of LPNs Afatinib loaded, Tf modified redox-sensitive LPNs (Tf-SS-Afa-LPNs) were self-assembled using a nanoprecipitation technique (Fig. 1) [27,28]. Afatinib (50 mg) and PLGA (200 mg) was dissolved in acetonitrile (20 mL) to form the organic phase. Lecithin (100 mg) and ChoPEG-SS-Tf (100 mg) were dissolved in an ethanol aqueous solution (4%, v/v). The organic phase was added dropwise to the aqueous solution under gentle stirring (300 rpm) and followed by vortexing for 3 min. The mixture was then stirred for an additional 4 h to self-assemble the LPNs and evaporate the organic solvent. An Amicon Ultra-4 centrifugal filter (molecular weight cut-off of 10,000 Da) was applied to remove the free molecules by washing the LPNs three times and resuspended in water to obtain a final desired concentration. The Tf-SS-Afa-LPNs were stored at 2–8 °C. No drug loaded, Tf modified redox-sensitive LPNs (TfSS-LPNs) was prepared without afatinib and used as a blank control. Afatinib loaded LPNs which do not contain Tf and redox-sensitive ligands (Afa-LPNs) were prepared using Cho-PEG instead of Cho-PEG-SSTf. 2.4. Characterization of LPNs The surface morphology of Tf-SS-Afa-LPNs was observed by a transmission electron microscopee (TEM, JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The sizes, zeta potentials, and polydispersity index (PDI) of LPNs were analyzed by Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS, Zeta sizer Nano ZS, Malvern Instruments, Worcestershire, UK) at room temperature [29]. To determine the drugs loading content, afatinib loaded LPNs were dissolved in methanol and vortexed. The supernatants were transferred to 5 mL of mobile phase. The mobile phase A was an acetic acid buffer 0.01% in water; mobile phase B was acetonitrile and gradient elution was applied using different A: B ratios [30]. The column was a Wondasil C18 (250mm*4.6 mm, 5 μm) maintained at 25 °C. Column temperature was fixed at 25 °C and flow rate was 0.4 mL/min. The detector wavelength was 255–265 nm. The drug loading (DL) and encapsulating efficiency (EE) of LPNs were calculated as: DL (%) = Weight of Afatinib loaded in LPNs / Weight of LPNs × 100; EE (%) = Weight of Afatinib loaded in LPNs / Weight of Afatinib totally added × 100. 2.5. In vitro GSH-triggered drug release study In vitro drug release behavior of Tf-SS-Afa-LPNs was investigated using a dialysis method in the presence of GSH [31]. Briefly, Tf-SS-AfaLPNs (5 mL) were sealed in dialysis bags (molecular weight cut-off of 2000 Da) and immersed in PBS containing GSH (0, 0.1, 1 and 10 mM) and Tween 80 (0.5%) which under constant shaking at 100 rpm (37 °C). At determined time intervals, release medium (2 mL) was taken out and replaced with the same fresh medium to keep the total volume. The samples were analyzed by the methods described in Section 2.4. 2.6. Cells and animals Two NSCLC cell lines (H1975, and PC-9 cells) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and DMEM medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS) were applied to culture the cells. Balb/c-nude mice (female, 20–25 g, 4–6 weeks) and Sprague-Dawley rats (female, 201–225 g, 7–8 weeks) were purchased from Beijing Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co., Ltd. and allowed to food and water ad libitum in an SPF-grade animal room. Lung cancer bearing model was prepared by subcutaneously injecting H1975 cells (5 × 106 , in 50 μL of PBS) into the forelimbs of female Balb/c-nude mice. All the animal experiments complied with the National Institutes of Health guide for the care and use of Laboratory animals. 2.7. Cell viability assay in hypoxic condition In vitro cytotoxicity of LPNs was evaluated by assessing the cell viability under normoxic (20% oxygen tension) or hypoxic condition (5% oxygen tension) using MTT assay [32]. H1975, and PC-9 cells were seeded in a 96-well plate (1 × 104 cells/well) either in normoxic or hypoxic condition for 24 h. LPNs with different concentrations were added and incubated for 72 h. Then the culture medium was removed and MTT solution (0.5 mg/mL, 100 μL) was applied for an additional 4 h and DMSO (150 μL) was added to extract the formazan crystals. The cell viability was calculated using an automated plate reader at the wavelength of 490 nm. The experiments were repeated for eight times. 2.8. Pharmacokinetic studies in vivo Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into three groups. Tf-SS-AfaLPNs, Afa-LPNs, and free afatinib were injected via the caudal vein at a dose of 2.5 mg drug /kg body [33]. Blood samples were collected in heparinized tubes at determined time points (0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 12, 24, 48, and 72 h) and centrifuged (3000 rpm, 10 min) to isolate the plasma. The separated plasma (100 μL) was centrifuged (10,000 rpm, 5 min) and of methanol (300 μL) was added. Then the plasma samples were transferred to the mobile phase and injected into the HPLC column and analyzed by the methods described in Section 2.4. 2.9. Tissue biodistribution in vivo Lung cancer bearing mice were applied to evaluate the tissue biodistribution of LPNs [34]. When the mean tumor volume reached ˜50 mm3 , the mice were randomized into three groups and injected (via the caudal vein) with Tf-SS-Afa-LPNs, Afa-LPNs, and free afatinib (2.5 mg drug /kg body). At determined time points, (1, and 12 h), mice were sacrificed and heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, and tumor tissues were collected, weighed, and ground with methanol. The homogenate was dissolved in methanol, mixed with the mobile phase and analyzed by the methods described in Section 2.4. 2.10. Anti-tumor efficiency in vivo Anti-tumor efficiency of LPNs was evaluated on lung cancer bearing mice after the mean tumor volume reached ˜50 mm3 [35]. The mice were randomized into five groups and injected (via the caudal vein) once a week for four weeks with Tf-SS-Afa-LPNs, Afa-LPNs (2.5 mg drug /kg body), free afatinib (5 mg drug /kg body), Tf-SS-LPNs, and 0.9% saline as control. The tumors were measured every four days using calipers and volume was calculated using the standard formula: V = (length × width2 )/2. Body weight of mice was measured every four days during the treatment to determine the toxicity of the systems. 2.11. Statistical analysis Data are reported as the mean ± standard deviation (SD). The statistical analysis was performed using analysis of variance. Statistically significant was determined when P < 0.05. 3. Results 3.1. Characterization of LPNs The surface morphology of Tf-SS-Afa-LPNs was presented in Fig. 1. Tf-SS-Afa-LPNs showed uniform particles with coats on the surface. The sizes, zeta potentials, PDI, DL and EE of LPNs were exhibited in Fig. 3. The size of Tf-SS-Afa-LPNs was larger than Afa-LPNs LPNs, which means the Tf decoration enlarged the size of the LPNs. Also Tf decoration neutralized the zeta potential from -31.7 (Tf-SS-Afa-LPNs) to -21.2 (Afa-LPNs). The PDIs of LPNs were between 0.1 and 0.2, with EEs around 90%. 3.2. In vitro GSH-triggered drug release study The release profiles in the presence of different GSH concentration were illustrated in Fig. 4. When the concentration of GSH reached 1 and 10 mM, significantly higher drug release was observed compared to 0 and 0.1 mM GSH. This could verify the GSH responsive drug release behavior. In the high GSH concentration (10 mM), over 80% of afatinib was released from Tf-SS-Afa-LPNs. On the contrary, the release of afatinib was lower in the low GSH concentration (P < 0.05). 3.3. Cell viability assay Cytotoxicity of LPNs was evaluated on two cell lines under normoxic or hypoxic conditions. Fig. 5 revealed that Tf-SS-Afa-LPNs had better tumor cells inhibition efficiency than Afa-LPNs and free afatinib under hypoxic condition (P < 0.05), which could serve as the evidence of the redox-sensitive Tf-SS-Afa-LPNs (Fig. 5B and D). However, there was no obvious difference among the three groups under normoxic condition on H1975 cells (Fig. 5A). Slightly higher efficiency achieved by afatinib loaded LPNs than free afatinib on PC-9 cells may due to the delivery ability of nanoparticles (Fig. 5C). 3.4. Pharmacokinetic studies in vivo The blood concentration-time profiles of Tf-SS-Afa-LPNs, Afa-LPNs, and free afatinib were presented in Fig. 6. Compared with the rapidly decreasing concentration of free afatinib, Tf-SS-Afa-LPNs and Afa-LPNs illustrate more sustained plasma retention effects. The area under the plasma concentration – time curve (AUC), peak concentration (Cmax) and terminal half life (T1/2) were summarized in Table 1. The AUC of Tf-SS-Afa-LPNs (866.56 mg/L·h) and Afa-LPNs (701.16 mg/L·h) was larger than that of free afatinib (404.73 mg/L·h) (P < 0.05). The significant difference in T1/2 indicated that the elimination of Tf-SS-AfaLPNs was slower and that the circulation time was longer. 3.5. Tissue biodistribution in vivo Tissue biodistribution of LPNs was assessed in lung cancer bearing mice. Rapid biodistribution (1 h) of afatinib was found into the major organs of mice after intravenous injection of Tf-SS-Afa-LPNs, Afa-LPNs, and free afatinib (Fig. 7 A). The amount of afatinib in the major organs decreased at 12 h (Fig. 7B). At both 1 and 12 h after intravenous injection, Tf-SS-Afa-LPNs showed higher afatinib distribution in tumors than that of Afa-LPNs (P < 0.05). In the meantime, Afa-LPNs exhibited higher tumor drug accumulation than free afatinib (P < 0.05). ice. Firstly, free afatinib showed considerable tumor inhibition ability than the control group (P < 0.05). Secondly, Afa-LPNs improved the antitumor effect of free afatinib to a large content (P < 0.05). Finally, Tf-SS-Afa-LPNs exhibited the most remarkable efficacy, which inhibited the tumor volume from 919 mm3 to 212 mm3 at day 28 of the study (P < 0.05) (Fig. 8A). Free afatinib group significantly decreased the body weight of the mice, while Tf-SS-Afa-LPNs and Afa-LPNs injected groups showed steady body weight during the 4 weeks study (Fig. 8B). 4. Discussion Redox-responsive delivery of chemotherapeutics tumor cells and tumor sites is an emerging field in biological therapeutics [36]. Redoxsensitive drug delivery systems are applied for the tumor targeted therapy due to the difference in redox potential in tumor and normal tissue [37]. It is reported that transferrin receptor-mediated endocytosis is a useful target for cancer therapy [38]. So in this study, a transferrin contained, redox-sensitive ligand (Cho-PEG-SS-Tf) was synthesized and used for the decoration of the nanoparticles. LPNs are next-generation core-shell nanostructures with a polymer core enveloped by a lipid layer [39]. The previous researches have constructed LPNs with uniform particle distribution and sizes between 100–200 nm [40,41]. The surface morphology of Tf-SS-Afa-LPNs in this study showed uniform particles with coats on the surface, this may prove the existence of Tf ligands. The size of Tf-SS-Afa-LPNs was larger than Afa-LPNs LPNs, which means the Tf decoration enlarged the size of the LPNs. Zhang et al prepared a kind of LPNs system which can reach 80–90% of encapsulation efficiency [42]. The results in our study were in accordance with them and around 90% of EEs were achieved by the prepared LPNs. GSH-triggered drug release was reported to be observed with the GSH concentration increased from 0 to 10 mM because of the presence of GSH-cleavable disulfide bonds [43]. In the release study section, significantly higher drug release was observed when the concentrations of GSH were 1 and 10 mM. This could verify the GSH responsive drug release behavior. These results indicated that the cumulative drug release was GSH concentration-dependent [44]: the afatinib release from LPNs could be triggered by GSH, which could be attributed to the rupture of disulfide bonds. Redox-sensitive LPNs was expected to enhance the cytotoxicity of the system in hypoxic condition [45]. Tf-SS-LPNs without drug showed no obvious toxicity, which suggested the biocompatibility of Tf-SSLPNs. Tf-SS-Afa-LPNs had better tumor cells inhibition efficiency than Afa-LPNs and free afatinib under hypoxic condition while no obvious difference was found under normoxic condition, which could serve as evidence of the redox-sensitive Tf-SS-Afa-LPNs. The pharmacokinetic and distribution results in vivo demonstrated the long circulation properties and high accumulation of the LPNs in tumor tissue, which were consistent with the report by Rezazadeh and colleagues [46]. In their study, ligands decorated nanocarriers showed higher plasma AUC, much longer systemic circulation time and much slower plasma elimination rate than those of undecorated nanocarriers after i.v. injection to the mice [47]. In the present research, compared with the rapidly decreasing concentration of free afatinib, Tf-SS-AfaLPNs and Afa-LPNs illustrate more sustained plasma retention effects. The AUC and t1/2 of Tf-SS-Afa-LPNs were also higher/longer than AfaLPNs and free afatinib, which indicated that the elimination Tf-SS-AfaLPNs was slower and that the circulation time was longer. After intravenous injection, afatinib was widely distributed into most tissues [48]. The highest afatinib concentration was achieved by Tf-SS-AfaLPNs group in the tumor at 1 h and declined progressively with the time. At both 1 and 12 h after intravenous injection, Tf-SS-Afa-LPNs showed higher afatinib distribution in the tumors than that of Afa-LPNs and free afatinib. High accumulation of LPNs was observed in the liver, which has an active reticulo-endothelial system (RES), suggesting that LPNs after systemic administration is trapped by the RES [49]. They could circulate in the blood as submicron particles for a certain time period, and then they might be recognized as foreign matters and rapidly cleared by RES which abounded in special tissues such as liver and lung. Therefore, LPNs had a markedly high concentration in these organs, meanwhile the drug concentration in the heart and kidney decreased. Similar results were reported by Wang et al [50]. In vivo anti-tumor study showed that significant tumor growth inhibition without obvious body weight loss was exerted when Tf-SS-AfaLPNs or Afa-LPNs were administered [51]. Tf-SS-Afa-LPNs group showed stronger tumor inhibition efficacy than non modified Afa-LPNs due to the Tf and redox-sensitive ligands modification [52]. These results were attributed to the efficient accumulation of Tf-SS-Afa-LPNs in the tumors through a combination of passive (enhanced permeability and retention effect) and active (Tf as a targeting moiety) targeting. TfSS-Afa-LPNs and Afa-LPNs injected groups showed steady weights. No noticeable loss of body weight of mice was considered as an indicator of safety [53]. 5. Conclusion In the present study, a Tf contained, redox-sensitive ligand was synthesized and used for the preparation of LPNs. The established TfSS-Afa-LPNs showed GSH-triggered drug release behavior, enhanced in vitro cytotoxicity in hypoxic conditions, and significant tumor growth inhibition ability in vitro without obvious body weight loss. The present report provides the basis for pursuing comprehensive preclinical studies on the efficacy, pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, and toxicology of this platform for NSCLC therapy	Jinli Wanga , Gaoxing Sub , Xiaoqin Yina , Jia Luoa , Rongrong Gua , Shuang Wanga , Jian Fengc,⁎⁎, Bohua Chen
9	2019	In vivo and in vitro biocompatibility study of novel microemulsion hybridized with bovine serum albumin as nanocarrier for drug delivery	ABSTRACT The present study aimed to synthesize triacetin-microemulsion (T-ME) and T-ME hybridized with bovine serum albumin nanoparticles (T-BSA-ME) having narrow particle size distribution and versatile carrier systems as a novel microemulsion system. The suggested ME system was characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). The physicochemical properties of microemulsion system including particle size, PDI and ζ-potential, refractive index, Conductivity, %Transmittance, pH, and rheological behavior were also evaluated. In vivo biocompatibility was done using Median Lethal Dose (LD 50) calculated and trialed to evaluate the acute toxicity. In Addition, hemolysis and leukocyte proliferation assay were characterized to evaluate in-vitro biocompatibility of the suggested MEs systems. Moreover, cytotoxicity of MEs systems was also investigated on HFF-2 and HEK-293 cells. The presence of BSA NPs as a macromolecular biomaterial hybridized with T-ME reduced the cytotoxicity. The properties of the suggested MEs system proposed the T-ME hybridized with BSA-NPs as a promising candidate for co-delivery and multifunctional biomedicine applications.  1. Introduction Microemulsions have many advantages such as, notably, optical transparency, low viscosity, single optically isotropic and thermodynamically stable isotropic systems, small particle size of <100, and the ability to be formed spontaneously without any need to high-shear equipment [1]. Due to having many unique properties, they are used in several pharmaceutical applications such as parenteral delivery, oral drug delivery, topical drug delivery, ocular and pulmonary delivery and biotechnology [2]. Microemulsions are composed of four components: the surfactant, co-surfactant, oil and aqueous phase [3]. They are divided into mainly three categories: water-in-oil (W/O), bicontinuous, and oil-in-water (O/W) microemulsions. The latest microemulsion type has been used as hydrophobic drug carrier, such as an anticancer drug. To fabricate of microemulsions, triacetin (glycerol triacetate) has been utilized as an oil phase (internal phase) [4]. It has several unique characteristics like nontoxicity, high hidrophobic drug solubilization capacity and Self-Emulsifying formulations ability, so it can be used as a co-solvent as well as an emulsification aid. Polyoxyethylene (20) sorbitan monooleate (Tween 80) and sorbitan monooleate (Span 80) are used as surfactant. Since Tween 80 have bulky polyoxyethylene groups, with a HLB of 15.0 and more solubility in water, it tends to form O/W emulsions [5]. Span 80, with a HLB value of 4.3, is a viscous, lipophilic, emulsifying liquid agent which tends to form W/O emulsions [6]. Moreover, Tween 80 and Span 80 are generally recognized as safe and are approved for use in a number of pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and food products because they are nonirritant and have a low potential for toxicity [6]. Themixture of Tween 80 and Span 80 enhanced the long-term stability as well as inclination to form expanded films in mixed monolayers, leading to an increase in hydrophobic area [7]. itable for being used as a co-surfactant [8, 9]. They are incorporated into the surfactant layer and thus, increases the interfacial fluidity. Furthermore, PG will decrease the polarity of the water because PG is mainly soluble in water, increasing the single-phase area. This phenomenon is very important in terms of application and economy. It should be noted that the main challenging factor in nanomedicine is how NPs can distinguish healthy tissue from damaged ones. For selective targeting of NPs into the pathogen sites, nanoparticle delivery system required targeting. Surface functionalizing NPs is the widely-used technique that allows conjugation with targeting ligands. It is inherently able to direct selected binding to cell types or states and therefore, confer “smartness” to NPs. The NPs surface is stimulated to conjugate with one or multiple cell ligands, resulting in an intelligent status. This technique has been widely used in various contexts. The major disadvantage of microemulsions, especially oil in water (O/W) type, is the lack of suitable surface that can accomplish this technique. To overcome the limitations of microemulsions, microemulsions hybridized with BSA nanoparticle were used as a novel strategy. BSA was widely used because of its non-toxicity, biodegradability, non-immunogenicity, water solubility, availability and its low cost, because large quantities of it can be readily purified from bovine blood [10]. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) is an important mode protein that has a molecular weight of 66 kDa and consists of about 583 amino acids with a structure like heart-shaped globular protein [11]. It has a variety of multiple functional groups at the surface, such as thiol, amine and carboxyl groups. As a result, its surface is activated by any functional groups (thiol, amine and carboxyl groups), as ligand, and can bind to significant amounts of the drug. We also PEGylated BSA NPs, to impart the in vivo longevity to drug carrier and reduce the protein binding (opsonization) [11, 12]. In this study, bovine serum albumin nanoparticles (BSA NPs) were used as excellent and powerful macromolecular biomaterials to activate microemulsions surface. In this method, BSA-PEG NPs were utilized as fraction of the microemulsions aqueous phase that activate microemulsions surface and stabilize the suggested microemulsions by the induced negative charge. The suggested microemulsions systems, triacetin in water (O/W) hybridized with BSA NPs (T-BSA-ME), were characterized by FT-IR, transmittance percentage, refractive index, pH analysis, conductivity, and thermal analysis. The cytotoxicity of MEs systems was evaluated as in vivo and in vitro. In vitro cell viability studies of microemulsions systems were carried out using HFF-2 and HEK-293 cells by MTT assay at different microemulsions concentrations for 48 h of incubation. In addition, biocompatibility of MEs systems was carried out using hemolysis and leukocyte proliferation assay. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Materials Triacetin (CAS.102-76-1), polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate (Tween 80- CAS.9005-65-6), propylene glycol (CAS.57-55-6), sorbitan monooleate (span80-CAS.1338-43-8)), BSA (CAS.9048-46-8), PEG (Mn ¼ 6000 Da) (CAS. 25322683) and MTT reagent were purchased from Sigma Aldrich Company in Germany. Other chemicals and solvents of high purity were purchased from Emertat chimi (Tehran- Iran). 2.2. Synthesis BSA-PEG –NP BSA-PEG-NP were prepared by desolation technique as reported by Merodio et al [13]. About 200 mg BSA and 20 mg PEG-6000 were dissolved in 3m of deionized water under constant Stirring and then, kept at room temperature for 15 min, followed by the adjustment of pH to 9.0 with 0.2 M NaOH. Then, it was added to the above solution dropwise under constant stirring at room temperature with a constant addition rate of 2 ml/min. In order to stabilize particles, they were cross-linked with 150 μl of 0.8% glutaraldehyde solution under stirring for 24 hours. The obtained NPs were subjected to centrifugation at 10000 rpm for 10 min for 3 cycles and the NPs were redispersed to the original volume in deionized water. The solution was lyophilized using freeze dryer and then, the dried NPs were collected as BSA-PEG NPs. 2.3. Synthesis O/W microemulsions hybrid with BSA-PEG NPs Modified O/W microemulsions were prepared by Tween80 and Span80 as mixture surfactant and propylene glycol as co-surfactant that were hybridized with BSA-PEG NPs. According to optimum formulation, 2.8% (0.28 g) BSA-PEG NPs was added to 9.72 g water; then, 17.48% (2.5g)W/W tween 80 and 2.97% (0.42g)W/W span 80 (as mixed surfactant), 4.37% (0.62g)W/W PG (as co-surfactant) were added to the aqueous solution, respectively, at 35–40 C under vigorous stirring for 15 min. Then, 5.24% (0.75g) W/W triacetin (as oil phase) was added dropwise to the aqueous phase to form O/W microemulsions hybridized with BSA-PEG NPs. 2.4. Physicochemical characterizations 2.4.1. FT-IR characterization of microemulsion hybrid with BSA-PEG NPs Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy of BSA, PEG, BSAPEG NPs, microemulsions free BSA-PEG NPs and microemulsions BSAPEG NPs were performed on KBr pellets with an FT-IR spectrophotometry (Spectrum Two, USA). The spectra were scanned over the range 400–4000 cm1 . 2.4.2. Particle size and ζ-potential analysis of samples perpetrated Dynamic light scattering (DLS) was used to determine mean particle size and size distribution (polydispersity index) of the modified O/W microemulsions by employing the Zeta sizer Nanoseries instrument (Malvern Nano ZS®, Malvern Instruments Ltd, Worcestershire, UK). 0.5 ml of microemulsions or modified microemulsions was diluted with 1.5 ml of ultra-pure water in a clean Malvern sample vial. The hydrodynamic, polydispersity index (PDI) and ζ-potential of all samples were analyzed by DLS. 2.4.3. Morphology analysis The microemulsions morphology was studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM) (JPK, Nano Wizard 2, and Berlin Germany). For AFM analysis, samples were diluted by deionized water and then the clean mica surface were smeared by a drop of the diluted sample, followed by being lyophilized to prepare a fixed sample. All AFM images were processed and analyzed using the JPK Data Processing software. 2.4.4. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) of Analysis (Mettler Toledo, model Star SW 9.30, Schwerzenbach, Switzerland) was applied for thermal analysis of the microemulsions BSA-PEG NPs Each sample was put inside the sealed aluminum-lead pans and run at a scanning rate of 15 C.min1 from 0 C to 300 C. 2.4.5. Conductivity measurements The electrical conductivity of the prepared MEs samples were measured by conductivity meter Metrohm Model 712. This experiment was performed at room temperature (25  1 C). All measurements were repeated three times. 2.4.6. pH determination of ME After calibration of pH meter with buffer solution of pH 4.0, 7.0, and 9.0, the pH values of MEs samples were measured at 25 C by a Corning 220 pH meter (Cole-Palmer, Teddington, UK). This experiment aimed to investigate the influence of ME type and presence or absence of BSA NP on pH and compare the results with those of blood plasma. The measurement of pH of MEs samples were done in triplicate and the mean values were calculated [14]. M. Gharbavi et al. Heliyon 5 (2019) e01858 2 2.4.7. Refractive index of ME Refractive index for MEs samples was measured by refractometer M46.17/63707 (Higler and Walts Ltd., England, UK) at 25 C by pouring one drop of solution in the slide. 2.4.8. Limpidity test (percent transmittance) Transparency of the prepared MEs samples was determined by measuring the amount of transmittance using spectrophotometry (Shimadzu, UV-160, Japan) [15]. Transmittance of ME was measured at 633 nm with double distilled water taken as blank. It was done three times for each sample [13]. 2.4.9. Rheological behavior The rheological properties of microemulsion and microemulsion hybridized with BSA NPs samples were measured using a viscometer (Brookfield Viscometer LTD) [16]. In all of the experiments, 800 μL of ME was placed into the surface of the reading plate, and the excess sample was removed. The data were collected using Brookfield Viscometer LTD Software. 2.5. Stability of ME To confirm the physical stability of the prepared MEs, the particle size distribution was investigated every 15 days for 90 days at room temperature by DLS. 2.6. Cell culture and cell viability For preliminary study of cell viability of the prepared MEs, the MTT (3-[4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2, 5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) assay test was selected. HFF-2 and HEK-293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified eagle medium (DMEM) with 10% Penicillin-Streptomycin (10% Pen-Strep) and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) in an incubator at 37 C under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 80% relative humidity. HFF-2 and HEK-293 cells were seeded at the density of 6103 cell per well in 96-well plates for 48 h (80% confluency). Then the cells were incubated for 48h with 200 μL of fresh culture medium containing six various concentrations ranging from 0-50 μg/mL of T-ME and the same serial concentration of T-BSA-ME and some wells without treatment as control. After the incubation time, the culture medium was removed and washed with PBS. Then, 20 μL of MTT (4 mg/mL) solution was added to each well and the plates were incubated in a humid environment containing 5% CO2 at 37 C. After 4 h of incubation, the medium was removed, and then 100 μL of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was added to each well for dissolving the violet formazan crystals. After shaking the plates for 15 min, cell viability was quantified by measuring the absorbance of the formazan at the wavelength of 570 nm with a microplate reader (Spectra Max 190). The data were expressed as the percentage of viable cells compared to the survival of the control group (untreated cells as controls of 100% viability). The data were expressed as the mean  standard deviation (SD) of three individual measurements. 2.7. Hemolysis assay Hemolysis refers to the damage of erythrocytes membrane, leading to the leaking out of erythrocyte intracellular content (Hemoglobin) into blood plasma. The occurrence of hemolysis inside the body can lead to anemia, jaundice and other pathological conditions, which may become life-threatening. Hemoglobin is one of the components of the red blood cells, carrying efficiently oxygen from lungs to the tissues of the body. It also plays an important role in transportation of carbon dioxide and hydrogen ions back to the lungs. However, extracellular hemoglobin is toxic and may affect vascular, myocardial, renal and central nervous system tissues. Since the microemulsion hybridized with BSA NPs is to be used for biomedical applications, hemolysis has to be addressed as an important issue in this regard. The toxicity degree (hemolytic effect) of MEs samples was evaluated by a previously reported method [17]. Healthy human red blood cells (RBC) were taken from the blood bank of Mousavi Hospital (Zanjan, Iran), collected in tubes with heparin and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 5 minutes. The plasma was removed, and RBCs were washed three times with PBS. The purified RBC was re-suspended in isotonic PBS until it was diluted to 10% of their initial concentrations, i.e. six different mass concentrations of T-ME and T-BSA-ME (10, 40, 70, 100, 130 and 160 μg/ml). The %1 Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and 500μl PBS was used as positive control (100% Hemolysis) and negative control (0% hemolysis), respectively. Aliquot of 200 μl RBC were added to the tubs. Then, all samples (sample treatment, positive control and negative control) were added to different tubs and incubated for 4 h in a 37 C water bath. After incubation, the tubes were centrifuged for 10 min at 4000 g at room temperature. Finally, 200 μl of the hemoglobin released into the medium was transferred to a 96-well plate. The absorbance was measured at 541 nm using a plate reader (Eppendorf Bio Photometer). This test was repeated three times. The amount of hemolysis in percent was calculated as follows: Hemolysisð%Þ ¼ Asample  Anegative Apositive  Anegative  100 where Asample was represents mean absorbance of ME (test). Likewise, Anegative, and Apositive represent mean absorbance of negative and positive control, respectively. 2.8. LD50 assay Different chemicals, such as triacetin, Tween 80, Span 80, BSA, and PEG that are used for ME formulations have different toxic effects. LD50 is one of the methods of measuring the short-term toxic potency (acute toxicity) of a prepared ME. In order to study the safety of the prepared ME, an acute oral toxicity study was done in adult mic. 10 Adult mice of an average weight of 30–35 g were taken in an ideal laboratory condition as per OECD [18]. To carry out LD50 assay, T-ME and T-BSA-ME in concentrations ranging from 175 to 5000 mg/kg were orally administered to each animal. All Animals were weighed before administration and also, after one day and one week. Likewise, during the test, any physical activities and behavioral changes of animals were monitored. If all the animals survived after 24 h, two other animals were treated at the highest does. If these animals survived too, the LD50 would be more than the dose limit and the test was stopped. 2.9. Leukocyte proliferation assay MEs have been used in many areas including anticancer drug delivery, local drug delivery, vaccine delivery, clinics. Hence, investigation of the effects of MEs on lymphocyte activation is the most important issue. For this assay, in order to isolate lymphocytes, 4 mL of blood/PBS mixture were poured in the conical centrifuge tube and then, 3 mL of Ficoll-Paque solution was slowly added and then, centrifuged for 30 min at 900 x g, 19 C, without brake. After the removal of supernatant, the remaining solution (mononuclear cell layer) was transferred into another centrifuge tube and cells ware washed by adding an excess of HBSS (Hank's balanced salt solution), and centrifuged for 10 min at 400 x g, 19 C. In the next step, mononuclear cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 (Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium-1640) medium in an incubator at 37 C under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 80% relative humidity. Monoclonal cells were seeded at the density of 2.5106 cell per well in 96-well plates for 48 h. Then, the cells were incubated for 48h with fresh culture medium, making them ready for evaluation of the lymphocyte proliferation activity (or inhibition). Lymphocyte proliferation activity was described with various concentrations of T-ME or TBSA-ME, including 2.0. 0.2, 0.04, and 0.008 mg/ml. Also, some wells without treatment and some wells with 50 μl of 20 μg/ml of PHA-P (phytohemagglutinin) were used as negative and positive control, M. Gharbavi et al. Heliyon 5 (2019) e01858 3 respectively. Likewise, lymphocyte proliferation inhibition was evaluated with various concentrations of T-ME or T-BSA-ME, including 4, 0.4, 0.08, and 0.016 mg/ml, mixed with 50 μl of 20 μg/ml PHA-P. After being incubated for 48 h, the culture medium was removed and washed with PBS. Then, 20 μL of MTT (4 mg/mL) solution was added to each well and the plates were incubated in a humid environment containing 5% CO2 at 37 C. After 4 h of incubation, the medium was removed, and then, 100 μL of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was added to each well for dissolving the violet formazan crystals. After shaking the plates for 15 min, cell viability was quantified by measuring the absorbance of the formazan at the wavelength of 540 nm with a microplate reader. The data were expressed as the percentage of proliferation and proliferation inhibition that are calculated as follows: %proliferation ¼ Mean ODtest sample  Mean ODuntreated cells Mean ODuntreated cells  100 %proliferation inhibition ¼ Mean ODPositive control  Mean ODPositive controlþME Mean ODPositive control  Mean ODuntreatedcells  100 where ODuntreated cell represent optical density of plates without test sample (as negative control). Likewise, ODtest sample, ODpositive control, and ODpositive controlþME were represents, optical density of plates in presence of MEs (test samples), PHA-P (as positive control), and PHA-P with ME, respectively. 2.10. Statistical analysis Statistical analysis of the data was carried up by the Graph Pad Prism 7 software. The experiments were repeated at least three times, and the data were expressed as means SD. For normally distributed data, oneway ANOVA with repeated measures was used to compare within the same group and Tukey's test for correction. Likewise, one-way ANOVA with Dunnett's test was used to compare mean between different groups. For the non-normally distributed data, the Kruskal-Wallis test and Fisher‘s exact test were employed for correction and categorical variables, respectively. P value <0.05 and ns considered as significant and not significant difference, respectively. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Optimum formulation of T-ME In order to fabricate ME systems, two phases were really needed: the aqueous phase that includes water, surfactant, and co-surfactant; the oil phase that includes oil composition. Propylene glycol (PG) and glycerol were selected as co-surfactants for screening. Martino A. and Lwanaga T showed that PG and glycerol incorporated into the surfactant layer, leading to an increase in the interfacial fluidity, due to the great solubility of PG and glycerol in water which in turn can decrease the polarity of the water. Hence, PG and glycerol could increase the flexibility of surfactant, allowing water droplets to merge and incorporate more water. As a result, PG and glycerol created a large single-phase region [9, 19]. Tween 80 was selected as surfactant due to its low toxicity, biocompatibility and high HLB value (HLB ¼ 15). Therefore, it is suitable for O/W type of ME [20]. Furthermore, Span 80 (HLB ¼ 4.3) and Tween 80 were mixed as surfactant, characterized by a viscous, lipophilic, emulsifying liquid agent and low HLB value. The results showed that the mixture of Tween 80 and Span 80 surfactants with significant different HLB values produce stable formulations (Table 1 and Fig. 1). Span 80 with low HLB value and Tween 80 with high HLB value were dissolved in oil phase and water, respectively, enabling them function together and leading to the stability of formulation [9]. Therefore, in ME composition, surfactant and co-surfactant type, as well as their concentrations are main parameters. Hence, in order to obtain the best formulation of O/W ME, different ratio of triacetin, water, surfactant, and co-surfactant were evaluated (Table 1). In the first six formulations, MEs were prepared without Span 80. The results showed that aqueous phase and organic phase were separated. The results indicated that Span 80 had an important role in the stability of formulation, which was confirmed with some previous study [21, 22]. In six formulation (13–18 formulations), although Span 80 was mixed with Tween 80 as surfactant, the prepared MEs were cloudy in appearance. This may resulted from the insufficiency of surfactant mixture (Tween 80 & Span 80) needed for the fabrication of microemulsion. With an increase in the surfactant ratio in the range of 19.73%– 20.66%, microemulsions showed slightly cloudy states. The reason was that the ratio of Span 80 was low and not sufficient for ME stability [23, 24]. Some of the prepared microemulsions (11 and 25 to 30 formulations) showed transparent states. The results indicated that in addition to the surfactant ratio, co-surfactant type and co-surfactant amount also played an important role in the stability and Physical appearance of formulations. Among all transparent formulations, 11 formulations were selected for further tests in this paper, since they had less surfactant. Another reason for such a selection was the toxicity of surfactant in high concentration. Furthermore, this was very important in terms of application and economy. 3.2. Characterization of particle size and morphology The formation of T-ME hybridized with BSA-NPs (T-BSA-ME) was approved by AFM. In detail, T-BSA-ME showed a globular shape and homogeneous spherical morphology, as expected (Fig. 2). Also, the size of T-ME and T- BSA-ME-were evaluated by dynamic light scattering system (DLS). As can be seen in Fig. 3, the average size of T-ME and T- BSA-ME-were found to be around 21.36 nm and 46.4 nm, with ζ-potential of -4.98 and -8.47 mV, respectively. The T-BSA-ME size was higher than that of T-ME because of the presence of BSA NPs, The negative charge value of ζ-potential was resulted from hydroxyl groups of surfactants, co-surfactant, and BSA NPs which contain amine and several functional groups with high electronegativity such as hydroxyl, amid and carboxyl functional groups [25]. Hence, the ζ-potential of T-BSA-ME was higher than that of T-ME [26]. 3.3. FT-IR analysis FT-IR spectroscopy was carried out to confirm the components of the T-ME hybridized with BSA NPs. As can be observed in Fig. 4, the FTIR spectrum analysis was used to indicate the compositions of BSA NPs, TME, and T-BSA-ME. The characteristic absorption peaks of BSA at 1700 and 1500 cm1were attributed to C¼O stretching vibrations (amide-I) and N–H bending vibrations (amide-II), respectively [27, 28]. All functional groups in T-ME (Fig. 3a) were similar to those of BSA NPs (Fig. 3b). As can be seen in Fig. 4, all the characteristic absorption peaks of T-ME (Fig. 4a) and BSA NPs (Fig. 4b) could be observed in the FTIR spectra of T-BSA-ME. Thereby, the results demonstrated that BSA NPs was successfully hybridized with T-ME. 3.4. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) DSC thermogram of BSA NPs, triacetin, T-ME, and T-BSA-ME was performed to evaluate each sample's thermal behavior (Fig. 5). Triacetin was characterized by the existence of an endothermic peak at 51.65 C and BSA NPs, about 78.52 C, while the T-ME and T-BSA-ME systems had no peak visible near the triacetin and BSA NPs's melting point. As can be observed, triacetin and BSA NPs were amorphous in ME systems. 3.5. Rheological behavior Rheological analysis of MEs is very important for many reasons including investigation of structural properties, system stability, handling, storage, and pipeline transportation of MEs [29, 30]. Fig. 6 shows the shear stress and viscosity as a function of the shear rate for the T-ME and T-BSA-ME, at room temperature and at atmospheric pressure. Fig. 6a revealed that, at lower shear rates (˂50 S1 ), the shear stress increased urgently, shear stress for T-ME increased slowly, while in T-BSA-ME, it was approximately constant. To describe the rheology behaviors, and to compare the candidate models for two MEs (T-ME & T-BSA-ME) datasets, Akaike's An Information Criterion (AIC) function were calculated for each model to help determine which model is the best. The AIC is defined as follows [31]: AIC ¼ 2  P þ N log RSS N where P, N, and RSS represents, number of parameters in the fitted model, the number of data set and residual sum of squares (RSS), respectively. A good model is the one that has minimum AIC among all the other models [32]. As can be shown in Table 2, the data obtained from all candidate models confirmed that both microemulsion systems (T-ME & T-BSA-ME) exhibited a non- Newtonian viscous behavior. Hence, according to the AIC value, the T-ME and T-BSA-ME systems were characterized by Power-Law/Ostwald and Herschel-Bulkley models, respectively. Evidently, the results confirmed that MEs systems (T-ME & T-BSA-ME) exhibited shear thinning pseudoplastic behavior because ??-values obtained were less than unity (??<1). Moreover, the hybridization of BSA NPs with T-ME did not alter the flow behavior of the MEs. Shear thinning behavior may be due to phase segregation in MEs be due to different formation and more organized microstructure. The viscous flow behavior of T-ME and T-BSA-ME were related to the apparent yield stress resulting from interactions between BSA NPs and the continuous or external aqueous phase [33, 34]. Meanwhile, the interactions between the BSA NPs surface and the aqueous phase might increase the stiffness, as pointed out by Zhong [35] and Hato [36]. Thus, the hybridization of BSA NPs with T-ME leads to an increase in viscosity. Aqueous media (continuous phase) as a polar solvent in the presence of BSA NPs resulted in the bulk viscosity and creation of a new internal phase. As a consequence, the presence of an internal aqueous phase increased dispersion viscosity, particularly in low shear rate range, as shown in Fig. 6b. Nonetheless, at high shear rates, the differences were significantly dampened. 3.6. Physicochemical characterizations The physicochemical characterizations of the MEs were shown in Table 3. The conductivity was profoundly sensitive both to temperature and composition. The composition of O/W ME system was fabricated with triacetin, Tween 80, Span 80, PG and water. In the case of the O/W MEs systems when the content of water is over 65 percent as the continuous phase, the conductivity of the systems increased. However, the W/O (water-in-oil) systems had low conductivity. The electrical conductivity was used to determine the type of microemulsions [37]. The electrical conductivity coefficient of T-ME and T-BSA-ME was revealed in 1.47 ms/cm and 2.49 ms/cm, respectively. the high value of conductivity coefficient is characteristic of oil-in-water (O/W) type of MEs (Table 3) [38, 39]. As can be seen, the conductivity coefficient of T-ME was higher than that of T-BSA-ME which was related to the higher percentage of water in T-ME compared with that of T-BSA-ME. The refractive index (RI) of T-ME and T-BSA-ME was found to be around 1.38 and 1.2, respectively. Therefore, as we discussed before, the RI of the system became equal to the water's RI (1.33). Furthermore, the transmittance of T-ME and T-BSA-ME was found to be 93.9% and 57.32%, respectively, indicating that the prepared ME were a transparent, single phase liquid, while the transmittance of T-BSA-ME was lower than that of T-ME that could be related to the presence of BSA NPs in the formulation. The pH value of T-ME and T-BSA-ME was in the range of 5.23–6.16. The pH value of the T-BSA-ME was less than that of T-ME, which could be associated to the presence of acidic groups at BSA structure. The MEs samples (T-ME & T-BSA-ME) stability was approved physically. MEs systems were also of good thermodynamic stability, due to ultralow interfacial tension between the oil and water phases. In order to describe the ME stability, the particle structure integrity and the possibility of aggregation were evaluated. Therefore, the particle size of ME as a function of incubation time was monitored for 3 months. As shown in Fig. 7, Z-average of T-ME and T-BSA-ME did not increase significantly throughout the measurement period. 3.7. Cytotoxicity study For clinical and biomedicine applications, toxicity is a critical factor that should be considered. Biomedicine applications of MEs are intentionally designed for several clinical uses. It is essential to approve that this offer does not have any adverse effect. Besides T-ME, BSA NPs hybridized with T-ME should also be evaluated in terms of the cytotoxicity effect on both HFF-2 and HEK-293 cell lines. The cytotoxicity effect of TBSA-ME on both HFF-2 and HEK-293 cell lines were evaluated and measured by MTT assay. The cells were incubated with various concentrations (50, 100, 200, 400, 600, 800 μg/ml) for 48 h in a 5 % CO2 atmosphere. As can be seen, Fig. 8 compares the cells viability in different T-ME and T-BSA-ME concentrations. The cell viabilities of HFF-2 cells after being treated with various concentrations of T-ME and T-BSA-ME ranged from 78.99  3.18 to 90.31  1.01% and 92.71  5.53 to 97.9  0.02% after 48 h, respectively. At the same time, viability of HEK-293 cells, after treatment with various concentrations of T-ME and T-BSA-ME, were obtained to be in the range of 74.84  4.2 and 85.56  3.6% and 85.75  3.52 and 90.28  3.04% after 48 h, respectively. Thereby, T-ME and T-BSA-ME were not significantly toxic on HFF-2 and HEK-293 cell lines, suggesting that MEs systems (T-BSA-ME especially) were of high-level biocompatibility and likely to be used for further in vivo applications. Data were analyzed using ANOVA, *p < 0.05 and ns considered as significant and not significant difference, respectively. 3.8. Hemolysis assay For biomedicine uses, MEs systems enter the body and interact with tissues and cells directly. It is necessary for the evaluation of their biocompatibility [40]. To determine the biocompatibility of the T-ME and T-BSA-ME, the MEs systems must have a blood compatibility with minimal hemolytic effect on human red blood cells. As can be seen in Fig. 9, the blood compatibility of T-ME and T-BSA-ME were evaluated at 10–160 μg/ml concentration range. The hemolytic activity of the samples was quantitatively determined by the evaluation of the supernatant absorbance at 540 nm (hemoglobin) with Eppendorf Bio Photometer The hemolytic activity of T-ME and T-BSA-ME in various mass concentrations was in the range of 6.32  0.02 to 13.00  0.12% and 9.09  0.00 to 15.87  0.00%, respectively. The hemolytic activity of MEs systems may be related to the presence of the surfactant that, when increases in the sample, causes an increase in the hemolytic rate [41]. Likewise, the T-ME revealed significantly higher hemolytic rates compared to T-BSA-ME in similar concentration that was due to the surfactant used. Data were analyzed using ANOVA, *p < 0.05 was considered as significant difference. 3.9. LD50 and acute toxicity For Median Lethal Dose (LD 50) test, we treated mice with a series of doses. Mice were treated with T-ME and T-BSA-ME, ranging from 17.5 to 5000 mg/kg. To find of out maximum safe dose, we used a control group administrated with saline and treatment groups were administrated with 17.5, 175, 1750, and 5000 mg/kg of T-ME and T-BSA-ME. The changes in the mice weight after 24 h and 7 days were around 1.58  3.64% and 5.42  1.78%. During the treatment, none of the mice died. So, using OCED and Hodge and Sterner scale, we concluded that the MEs systems introduced were practically none toxic [42]. 3.10. Leukocyte proliferation assay Lymphocyte proliferation is one of the basic characteristic of the response of lymphocytes to antigenic stimulation. In order to measure the ability of ME system to induce a proliferative response in human Lymphocyte, along with proliferation percentage, the percentage of proliferation inhibition should be evaluated. For this Assay, Lymphocyte were isolated from human whole blood using Ficoll-Paque solution and then, it was cultured. The amount of Proliferation showed MEs ability to induce leukocytes proliferation compared with untreated sample. The amount of proliferation inhibition also showed MEs inhibitory effects on PHA as a proliferative factor [43, 44]. As can be seen in Fig. 10, the proliferation rate of triacetin and T-BSAME in various concentrations ranged from-36.6 to -1.61% and -49.98 to -2.95%, respectively. These results revealed that the proliferation rate of the suggested MEs systems was lower than that of untreated samples (especially in high concentration). Likewise, the proliferation inhibition rate of triacetin and T-BSA-ME in various concentrations ranged from 47.15 to 1.93% and 52.7 to 2.99%, respectively. The results indicated that the suggested MEs systems could act as a Lymphocyte proliferation inhibitory in presence of PHA as a proliferative factor (positive control). Data were analyzed using ANOVA, and*p < 0.05 was regarded as significant difference. 4. Conclusion The present paper aimed to design and prepare T-BSA-ME, practically none toxic with potential applications such as co-delivery and multifunctional systems. In vitro and in vivo cytotoxicity evaluation revealed that the suggested MEs systems were safe and none toxic. Likewise, they were biocompatible, not active for Leukocyte Proliferation. The nontoxicity of the systems significantly increased their applicability in the development of in-vitro and in-vivo biomedicine fields such as brain codelivery or multifunctional system in neurodegenerative and cancer diseases. It is worth noting that this study established the foundation for effective preparation of T-BSA-ME for further in vitro and in vivo studies (in progress) on conjugates of T-BSA-ME with drugs, drug candidates, targeting agent, and molecular probes.

10	2019	Predicting pharmacokinetic behaviour of drug release from drug-eluting embolization beads using in vitro elution methods	ABSTRACT Drug-eluting Embolic Bead - Transarterial Chemoembolisation (DEB-TACE) is a minimally invasive embolising treatment for liver tumours that allows local release of chemotherapeutic drugs via ion exchange, following delivery into hepatic arterial vasculature. Thus far, no single in vitro model has been able to accurately predict the complete kinetics of drug release from DEB, due to heterogeneity of rate-controlling mechanisms throughout the process of DEB delivery. In this study, we describe two in vitro models capable of distinguishing between early phase and late phase drug release by mimicking in vivo features of each phase. First, a vascular flow system (VFS) was used to simulate the early phase by delivering DEB into a silicon vascular cast under high pulsatile flow. This yielded a burst release profile of drugs from DEB which related to the dose adjusted Cmax observed in pharmacokinetic plasma profiles from a preclinical swine model. Second, an open loop flow-through cell system was used to model late phase drug release by packing beads in a column with an ultra-low flow rate. DEB loaded with doxorubicin, irinotecan and vandetanib showed differential drug release rates due to their varying chemical properties and unique drug-bead interactions. Using more representative in vitro models to map discrete phases of DEB drug release will provide a better capability to predict the pharmacokinetics of developmental formulations, which has implications for treatment safety and efficacy. 1. Introduction Drug-Eluting embolization Beads (DEBs) have been developed primarily for the locoregional treatment of malignancies in the liver by means of minimally invasive delivery through Trans-arterial Chemoembolisation (TACE) (Nicolini et al., 2011). There are now several commercially-available devices on the market that are all generally composed of hydrogel microspheres of calibrated sizes that are capable of interacting with certain drugs by an ion-exchange process (Facciorusso, 2018; de Baere et al., 2016). For example, DC Bead™ are composed of a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) hydrogel modified to contain negatively charged sulfonate groups, enabling ionic interaction with positively charged drugs which is reversible in ion-rich environments such as blood (Lewis, 2009). These devices are supplied to the hospital pharmacy where they are loaded with the appropriate chemotherapeutic drug and then supplied to the physician for administration using X-ray guided navigation through the blood vessels into the liver in order to target the site of the tumour. The choice of drug is dependent upon the type of liver tumour being treated and the physician's preference. For the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC, primary liver cancer) (Lammer et al., 2010) or certain tumours that have spread to the liver such as breast cancer metastases (Martin et al., 2012), the most common agent selected is doxorubicin hydrochloride at a dose of 25 or 37.5 mg/mL of hydrated beads, but in some instances structurally similar anthracycline drugs such as epirubicin (Nicolini et al., 2010) or idarubicin (Boulin et al., 2014) have been used as alternatives. On the other hand, metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) to the liver has been treated with DEBs loaded with irinotecan hydrochloride using a slightly modified administration technique (Martin et al., 2009, 2011; Taylor et al., 2007). Most recently there has been much interest in the delivery of other more targeted therapeutic agents from DEBs, in particular the multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (MTKi) which have inhibitory effects on tumour microvasculature (Fuchs et al., 2014; Hagan et al., 2017; Lahti et al., 2015). Indeed, the first HCC patients have recently been treated in a clinical trial where the MTKi vandetanib has been preloaded onto a DEB, in this case a newer device platform which is also radiopaque in nature and therefore can be visualized intra and postprocedurally using X-ray based imaging methods (Ashrafi et al., 2017; Duran et al., 2016; ClinicalTrials.gov, 2017). As interest in DEB-mediated local delivery of different chemotherapeutic drugs grows, there is a need to be able to screen these agents using in vitro methodologies that provide some level of prediction as to how the drug may be released in vivo. There have been many different types of elution test described for the evaluation of DEBs, including simple USP Type II apparatus studies which are suited for Quality Control tests to ensure uniformity between batches, but are uninformative on how the products will release drug once placed within a blood vessel (Gonzalez et al., 2008). USP Type IV and T-cell Apparatus have been shown to be more predictive of the in vivo situation, as they allow for elements of drug diffusion and convection (Gonzalez et al., 2008; Amyot et al., 2002; Fuchs et al., 2015; Jordan et al., 2010). As drug elutes from the beads and travels through the embolised vessel walls into tissue, the drug's physicochemical properties will dictate how it diffuses and interacts with cells or is eventually carried away as it enters more distant vessels in which blood flow is maintained. Elements of drug metabolism however, cannot be easily accommodated in these models. More recently, we have described an open-loop flow through system which under the right conditions can be representative of the long-term release that has been observed for doxorubicin in explanted tissues (Swaine et al., 2016). None of these methods however, are particularly applicable to the initial 24 h post-delivery of the beads, where the peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) can be a predictor of the levels of systemic toxicity that might be experienced by the patient (Song & Kim, 2017; Lencioni, 2012). The reason for this lack of correlation is because established in vitro tests usually begin with a “pre-occluded system” in which the beads have already been placed into a situation that represents a post-administration occlusive mass (Caine et al., 2017a). In order to properly evaluate how a DEB will respond to delivery in vivo, the administration phase must also be mimicked as per the schematic in Fig. 1. The beads must be mixed with contrast agent before delivery, which, depending on the ionic composition of the contrast agent, can induce in itself a small degree of drug elution from the surface layers of the beads. The bead/contrast suspension is then slowly delivered in small “puffs” at a rate of around 1 mL of suspension per minute in order that the beads are carried by the blood into the arterial high flow areas (normally the tumour when it is hypervascular in nature) and distribute into the distal arterioles without premature proximal blockage (phase 1, the initial 15–30 min during bead delivery). If the drug-bead interaction is weak, caused for example by steric hindrance and/or charge delocalisation at the drug binding site (Biondi et al., 2013), there may be a burst of drug release during this phase as the beads are surrounded by ion-rich blood which is an effective medium for the sequestration of drug (Jordan et al., 2010; Taylor et al., 2007). Beads will fill vessels distally and compact until they form a cast within the vessel architecture and flow between and around the beads is slowed to near stasis (phase 2, which starts to occur whilst the beads are still being delivered but would represent the next 15–30 min as the beads redistribute and compact into the vessels). Finally, the stagnated blood between the beads will eventually clot to form an occlusive mass, and ions from the surrounding tissues will diffuse into the mass and exchange for the drug bound to the bead reservoirs, leaving the drug to diffuse into the surrounding tissues by mass transfer (phase 3, which starts to occur once the beads have formed an occlusive mass and can continue for days to weeks depending upon the drug and dose delivered). In this study, we report for the first time on a drug elution test method that mimics the drug release during the DEB administration procedure (phases 1 and 2 in Fig. 1) and provides a vehicle for a semiquantitative prediction of drug plasma exposure over the first 24 h post DEB delivery. The ability to predict this early phase of drug release is of fundamental importance in the evaluation of these products, as this dictates the peak plasma levels and hence systemic exposure to the drug and likelihood of drug-related toxicities. This was achieved by comparing the drug elution profiles generated using both a custom-built Vascular Flow System (VFS) and the previously reported open-loop method, with the pharmacokinetic data obtained from the swine hepatic artery embolization model. Doxorubicin release from standard DEB (DC Bead™) was compared to that from a radiopaque DEB (DC Bead LUMI™), followed by an evaluation of elution of three different drugs loaded onto the radiopaque drug-eluting bead: doxorubicin (LUMIDOX), irinotecan (LUMIRI) or vandetanib (LUMIVAN). These drugs were chosen as they have all been used in the clinic for the treatment of hepatic malignancies. 2. Methods 2.1. Materials DC Bead™ and DC Bead LUMI™ (both 70–150 μm) were provided by Biocompatibles UK Ltd. (Farnham, UK). Doxorubicin HCl (Zheijan Hisun Pharmaceutical Co., China), irinotecan HCl (ScinoPharm, Taiwan) and vandetanib (> 99% purity, Sanofi Genzyme, UK) were supplied as powders and dissolved in ultrapure water to the desired concentration to provide drug loading solutions. Vandetanib solution was acidified to pH 4.7 with hydrochloric acid to aid drug solubility. Non-ionic contrast agent composed of 755 mg/mL iohexol Fig. 1. Schematic of the phases of DEB delivery. Phase 1: DEB suspension is injected via the hepatic artery and exposed to free flowing, ion-rich blood. Phase 2: DEB begin to embolise distal vessels inducing near stasis of blood flow. Phase 3: DEB establish clots in tumour vessels and drug is released into tissue via diffusion. Adapted from (Caine, 2017). (Omnipaque™ 350) was purchased from GE healthcare (UK). Phosphate buffered saline (PBS), (pH 7.0, 137 mM NaCl) was used as the in vitro elution medium and was purchased from Source Bioscience (Nottingham, UK). 2.2. Drug-loading of beads Beads were loaded with doxorubicin, irinotecan and vandetanib at 37.5 mg, 50 mg and 100 mg per mL of hydrated beads, respectively. Specifically, this involved removal of the saline packing solution with a pipette to leave an approximate volume of 2 mL of bead slurry with minimal remaining liquid. The appropriate volume/concentration of drug was added to the vial containing the slurry to achieve the desired loading and left for a minimum of 1 h for doxorubicin and irinotecan and 2 h for vandetanib, with occasional agitation. 2.3. Drug-loaded bead characterization and contrast agent compatibility Optical microscopy was used to investigate morphology of radiopaque beads post drug loading. DEBs were placed in Petri dishes in a monolayer and an Olympus BX50 microscope with attached Colorview III camera was used to capture optical micrographs of each bead sample. Calibrated sizing software (Stream, Olympus, UK) was used to measure the diameter of 200 beads per sample. 1 mL of each DEB was suspended in 10 mL of neat contrast agent (Omnipaque 350) by transfer between two syringes via a 3-way connector. To assess drug release into the contrast agent, the suspensions were stored at room temperature and aliquots of contrast agent were analysed for drug content over a 24 h period by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) (see Supplementary Information for method details). 2.4. Early phase elution model: the Vascular Flow System The Vascular Flow System (VFS) used to study drug elution during the administration phase was based on the apparatus previously described for use in the investigation of the flow dynamics of Y90 microspheres (Caine et al., 2017b). The system is comprised of a silicon cast (Elastrat Sarl, Geneva, Switzerland) with circular channel crosssections, a 4-mm inlet, and six 0.9-mm outlets (Fig. 2A). In this instance, the VFS, positioned flat on the bench, was circulated with PBS pre-warmed to 37 °C using a peristaltic pump to induce pulsatile flow of 120 mL/min and the circuit modified as shown in Fig. 2(A). A microcatheter (Progreat® 2.4 F, Terumo, Belgium) was steered into a fixed location beyond the first bifurcation point (red arrow, Fig. 2(A)), in order that two of the six outlet filters became the target embolization sites, which were accordingly blocked with a 27 μm mesh (Sefar AG, Switzerland). The remainder of the outlets, not being exposed to the DEBs, were recirculated back into the PBS reservoir. DEB/contrast agent suspensions as prepared in Section 2.3 were then slowly administered into the VFS using a syringe pump set at a continuous rate of 1 mL/min where upon the beads would exit the microcatheter and collect in the outlet filter, producing an occlusive mass and reducing the eluent flow. The eluent was collected from these outlets, starting from the initiation of the DEB delivery and every minute for the first 10 min then every 5 min until a 30 minute test period was complete. Drug concentrations in the eluent at each collection time point were determined using UV spectroscopy (doxorubicin, 483 nm; irinotecan 369 nm) or HPLC (method for vandetanib analysis in supplementary information) and an elution curve was constructed from the data. 2.5. Mid phase elution model: open loop flow through system Drug release from radiopaque beads was also profiled in a slow rate, flow through cell open loop system (Fig. 2(B)) as described previously (Swaine et al., 2016). Drug loaded beads (1 mL settled volume) were sandwiched between two filter membranes in an elution cell, submerged in a water bath maintained at 37 °C and protected from light. PBS was pumped through the system at a flow rate of 0.1 mL/min, in order to mimic slow residual blood flow after embolization. Detection of drug concentration in the eluent over time was performed by automated UV spectroscopy of eluent passing through a flow through cuvette (doxorubicin, 483 nm; irinotecan, 369 nm; vandetanib, 330 nm). Drug concentration was calculated from absorbance data using standards of known concentration for each drug to enable construction of elution curves. 2.6. Swine hepatic artery embolisation procedure In order to compare the in vitro elution profiles with relevant in vivo data, pharmacokinetic data was obtained from a pre-clinical study of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) using drug-eluting beads in healthy swine. The embolisation procedure was carried out at MPI Research (Mattawan, Michigan, USA) using experimentally naïve male domestic Yorkshire crossbred swine (farm pigs, weights 53.5–66.5 kg at randomization), as previously described (Denys et al., 2017). The research centre is AAALAC accredited and the study conformed to USDA Animal Welfare Act (9 CFR parts 1, 2 and 3) and to the ‘Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals’, Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources, National Academy Press, Washington, D.C, 2011. In brief, each DEB, loaded as described in Section 2.1, was suspended in Omnipaque 350 contrast agent (an iodinated compound in aqueous solution that is injected into the blood vessels to render the vessels visible under X-ray imaging). In accordance with their respective instructions for use, DC Bead were suspended in a 50:50 contrast agent: saline mixture and DC Bead LUMI were suspended in neat contrast agent. In both cases the ratio of beads to contrast or diluted contrast was 1:10. Uniform suspensions were achieved by mixing between two syringes via 3-way stopcock. The bead suspension was aliquoted into a 3 mL syringe for delivery through the microcatheter to allow for better control and re-suspended regularly to prevent sedimentation. Access and selection of the main hepatic artery was achieved using a 2.7 Fr microcatheter (Progreat®, Terumo Japan). An arterial branch that fed around 50% of the liver volume was identified and an angiogram of the liver lobe(s) taken. With the catheter in position at the target location, the selected DEB was administered slowly under continuous fluoroscopy, evaluating changes in vascular flow rate and appearance of reflux or non-target embolization of the beads (inferred from visible contrast flow). The maximum volume was administered for all animals (target volume 1 mL of sedimented beads). Dosing occurred in the left lateral lobe or left median lobe for all animals. After all images were obtained, all guides, catheters, and the sheath were removed and the femoral artery ligated; the muscle and subcutaneous tissues were closed with absorbable sutures and the skin was closed with skin glue. Blood samples were collected from all animals via the jugular or ear vein for determination of the plasma concentrations of doxorubicin, irinotecan, or vandetanib. Samples were collected pre-dose and at selected intervals following administration, up to 14 days. Plasma was analysed for the concentration of doxorubicin, irinotecan or vandetanib using validated LC-MS-MS methods specific to each drug (see supplementary information). Individual doxorubicin, irinotecan, and vandetanib plasma concentration-time profiles from treated animals were analysed using model independent methods in Phoenix® WinNonLin® software (Certara, USA). For each animal, the following plasma pharmacokinetic parameters were determined: maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax), time of maximum observed plasma concentration (Tmax), and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC). The AUC from time 0 to 336 h (AUC0–336h), the AUC from time 0 to the time of the final quantifiable sample (AUCTlast), and the AUC from time 0 to infinity (AUCINF) were calculated by the linear trapezoidal method for all animals with at least three consecutive quantifiable concentrations. A. Hagan, et al. European Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences 136 (2019) 104943 3 Half-life values (T1/2) were reported for each plasma concentrationtime profiles that had sufficient plasma concentrations in the terminal elimination phase (at least three samples not including Tmax) and an adjusted R2 of ≥0.9. 2.7. In vitro in vivo correlation (IVIVC) Two approaches for IVIVC were used depending on the elution model being evaluated. For the early phase VFS model, the effect of drug elimination was considered less important due to the short duration (30 min) of the experiment. Therefore, a simple point to point comparison was made between plasma AUC calculated with the trapezoidal method, plotted against % cumulative release in vitro, in order to assess correlation. For the later phase flow through elution data, a convolution method was used to convert in vitro dissolution profile to a predicted plasma profile using the method described by Qureshi (Qureshi, 2010). The amount of drug released between time points (amt (mg)) was calculated and a first order elimination model was applied to determine drug elimination over time. The sum of the drug amount remaining (in mg) for each time point was then converted to a predicted plasma concentration (C) in ng/mL (Eq. (1)). = × × C amt V body weight 1000 d (1) where Vd is the volume of distribution of the drug expressed in L/kg. Bioavailability was considered to be 100% due to intra-arterial administration, therefore was not accounted for in the equation. T1/2 and Vd for vandetanib and irinotecan in swine were obtained from calculated values reported in the pre-clinical study reports for LUMIVAN and Fig. 2.

These values were not able to be calculated for LUMIDOX, therefore T1/2 and Vd for doxorubicin in swine were obtained from the literature, 2.6 h and 4.86 L/kg respectively (Dubbelboer et al., 2014). Average pig body weights in kg were obtained from the pre-clinical study reports. AUC of the predicted and actual plasma profiles between t = 0 and the last shared time point for which C > 0 were calculated using the trapezoidal method and correlated. 3. Results 3.1. Comparison of non-radiopaque and radiopaque microspheres The elution and plasma profiles of the non-radiopaque DC Bead were firstly compared with the radiopaque DC Bead LUMI, to understand the influence of bead chemistry on elution rates in the different models with doxorubicin as a representative drug (Fig. 3). The in vitro models demonstrated that doxorubicin is released from DC Bead LUMI at a slower rate than from DC Bead, as evidenced by a smaller elution ‘burst’ and Cmax in VFS model, a pattern which was well reflected in the early swine pharmacokinetic profile (Fig. 3A & C). The slow flow through cell model also showed a difference between the two bead types, with the radiopaque beads releasing a lower proportion of the doxorubicin dose compared with non-radiopaque beads: 40% of the dose was eluted after 12 days compared with 70% for DC Bead (Fig. 3B). However, the level of doxorubicin in the plasma declined at a similar rate for both bead types, reaching low levels (< 1 ng/mL) by 24 h and becoming undetectable by 72 h after administration (Fig. 3D). 3.2. Radiopaque drug-loaded bead characterization and leaching in contrast agent Focusing on the radiopaque bead platform, the characteristics of DEBs loaded with the three different drugs were then examined. Loading of the radiopaque beads with the various drugs under study led in each case to a DEB formulation consisting of perfectly spherical and smooth beads with a precisely identified drug dose and within the specified 70–150 μm size range (averages between 90 and 100 μm) as shown in Fig. 4. The amount of drug released from radiopaque DEBs during contrast agent storage over a 24 h period was shown to vary depending on drug type. The amount of vandetanib released from LUMIVAN into the contrast medium 15 min after mixing was 3.3 mg, which increased to just 3.5 mg in total after 24 h storage at room temperature representing 3.5% of the loaded dose. On the other hand, irinotecan was quickly leached from LUMIRI upon mixing with contrast agent, and the amount released continued to increase with extended storage, from 1.9% (immediately after mixing) to 10.8% (4 h). LUMIDOX was stable in contrast agent and eluted only 0.2% of the loaded dose in up to 4 h of storage. There was no further leaching of irinotecan or doxorubicin after 4 h, suggesting equilibrium concentrations were achieved for these drugs in the given volume of contrast agent. 3.3. In vivo pharmacokinetics of radiopaque DEB (swine study) The pharmacokinetic profiles for the three drugs are seen to be different in each case when comparing the curve shapes in Fig. 5(A), which shows the respective plasma concentrations for each drug over the first 24 h following DEB administration. The Cmax (see also Table 1) for LUMIRI is much higher than for LUMIDOX and LUMIVAN. LUMIDOX reaches Cmax within minutes and declines rapidly, whereas LUMIRI takes between 1 and 2 h and declines over the next 24 h. LUMIVAN shows a relatively low Cmax at about 1 h and persists in the plasma with a slow decline over several days. Fig. 5(B) provides an alternative 24 h plot whereby double Y axes are used to allow the LUMIRI to be scaled to the same order of magnitude as the other DEBs, and Fig. 5(C) shows the same data over a 120 h period to demonstrate the long period over which vandetanib can be detected in the plasma post administration. Plotting the log10 of plasma concentrations (Cp) vs time resulted in different slopes for the different drugs (Fig. 5(D)). Vandetanib and irinotecan showed a linear relationship between log Cp and time, indicating that the pharmacokinetics of these drugs are best fit by a onecompartment model. On the other hand, doxorubicin pharmacokinetics appeared to be more multi-phasic, which suggests a multi-compartment model may be applicable, as has been previously suggested (Gustafson et al., 2002; Reich et al., 1979). 3.4. Early phase in vitro drug release (VFS model) The drug release profile obtained using the VFS elution model representing the first 30 min of bead administration is shown in Fig. 6 represented as raw concentration time data (A) and cumulative release as percentage of the total dose (B). The elution rate peaks within the first 5 min, demonstrating a ‘burst’ effect that is clearly more pronounced with irinotecan than with vandetanib or doxorubicin. The accumulation of beads in the channel ends led to a dramatic decrease in eluent flow rate passing through the occlusive bead mass, which corresponded with the drop in elution rate. The flow rate profile was similar for each DEB tested. The amount of drug released over 30 min corresponded to approximately 9% of the total dose for irinotecan, 2.6% for doxorubicin and 2.1% for vandetanib. Fig. 6(C) shows the correlation of the VFS elution data with the first 30 min of the in vivo plasma pharmacokinetic profiles. The AUC of doxorubicin and irinotecan plasma profiles were calculated using the trapezoidal method, and plotted against cumulative % release from the VFS elution data at corresponding time points (2, 5, 11, 25 min from start of bead administration). Doxorubicin showed a more linear correlation than irinotecan, but in both cases the data appeared better fitted by an exponential curve, indicating that drug was released faster in vitro than in vivo. Tmax for doxorubicin were in a similar timeframe in vitro and in vivo (t = 0.9 min vs t = 4 min respectively). The difference was greater for irinotecan, with the VFS showing Tmax to be 2 min, whereas maximal plasma concentrations were seen at approximately 1 h in the swine model. The frequency of blood draws in the vandetanib bead swine pre-clinical study was not sufficient to allow a point-topoint correlation with VFS data. However, Tmax were compared and also found to differ significantly, with the VFS model showing Tmax at 3 min compared with 2 h in vivo. The dose adjusted Cmax values were not drastically different between in vivo and in vitro, indicating that similar proportions of the drug dose contained within the beads were released in the early phase set up, albeit at an accelerated time course. The compared Cmax and Tmax for each drug are summarised in Fig. 6(D). 3.5. Later phase in vitro drug release (open loop flow through model) Comparison of the later phase release (post formation of an occlusive mass of beads) of the various DEBs as modelled using the open-loop flow through model is shown in Fig. 7(A) as dose with time (expansion inset 7(B)), and Fig. 7(C) as cumulative percentage dose released. Using this method, irinotecan is still seen to release relatively rapidly compared to the other drugs with complete release achieved in around 2 days. Doxorubicin displays a sustained and slow elution, with around 45% of the dose eluted within 16 days and continuing at a slow rate. Vandetanib displays an intermediate release pattern, with a linear zero order release phase over the first 5 days that plateaus after 90% is eluted. Comparing the raw concentration-time data for the flow through model with the in vivo PK data, we see that the Tmax are fairly similar to their in vivo counterparts for vandetanib and irinotecan (3 h vs 1 h, 2.2 h vs 2 h respectively), but the duration of drug release in the model persists longer than the presence of drug in plasma. In order to achieve optimal IVIVC, a linear correlation would be A.

AUC calculated from the raw concentration time data from the flow through model correlated better than the convoluted data in this case, but both fits had an r2 > 0.9. The steep slopes of the compared AUCs for doxorubicin and irinotecan in the first hour is indicative of the drug being observed in the plasma in vivo much faster than it was observed in the in vitro test (data not shown). The raw in vitro data from the slow flow through model were convoluted using a first order elimination model as described in Eq. (1) (Fig. 9). The convoluted flow through data for LUMIVAN and LUMIRI showed similarity in curve shape to the plasma profiles, predicting a similar elimination time course for the drugs from the plasma. The convolution was not extended past 48 h due to the infrequency of comparable data points beyond this time: the average plasma Tlast for LUMIRI, LUMIDOX and LUMIVAN were 12 h, 48 h and 72 h respectively. The predicted maximum plasma concentrations as well as AUC for all DEBs were between 5.2 and 66.3-fold lower than the actual values, however at later stages (24–48 h) the predicted and actual concentrations begin to converge. The in vitro Tmax in all cases occurred several hours later compared with in vivo. For doxorubicin, the convoluted elution profile did not correlate well in terms of curve shape with the actual plasma profile, predicting a much lower Cmax and slower elimination of the drug. However, from 12 h onwards, the predicted and actual doxorubicin concentrations are within 1–2 ng/mL of each other, which may explain why the compared AUCs differed less than the Cmax values. 4. Discussion 4.1. Effect of drug chemistry on release from DEB Drug release from the DEBs used in this study is based on ion exchange (Lewis, 2009). Upon contact with biological fluids, small cations exchange with the positively charged drug molecules in the microsphere matrix. The rate controlling mechanisms for different drugs, for example doxorubicin and irinotecan, have been found to vary based on differing molecular interactions between drug and bead (Biondi et al., 2013), which explains differences in release rates observed both in vitro and in vivo. Doxorubicin binds via a primary amine group, which is expected to interact more strongly with the beads than irinotecan's tertiary amine, and also exhibits pi-pi stacking which could be a cause of drug aggregation within the bead leading to slow elution (Ahnfelt et al., 2016). Indeed, a high propensity to form aggregates has been correlated with slower release rates of amphiphilic substances from DEBs (Ahnfelt et al., 2018). Vandetanib possesses two potential ionic binding sites dependent on the pH and subsequent protonation state of the molecule (see Fig. 4): at pH 7, only the tertiary amine is protonated, whilst at loading pH (4.6–4.8) 30–40% of molecules are expected to carry an additional positive charge in the pyrimidine group. We have previously described how this property affects the vandetanib loading capacity into DEB due to occupation of multiple binding sites per molecule, however it does not significantly affect the drug release rate of beads loaded at different pH due to partial charge neutralisation in the pH 7 PBS elution medium (Hagan et al., 2017). It does however, explain why vandetanib is released more quickly from the open-loop flowthrough method than expected based on solubility of the free-base alone, as the protonated form is released from the bead and remains partially protonated and hence more soluble within the PBS. In the models employed in this study, vandetanib was released from DEBs more slowly than irinotecan, but faster than doxorubicin, suggesting it forms weaker drug – bead interactions than the latter and/or lacks the drug-drug interactions that exist for doxorubicin. This resulted in the complete release of vandetanib from DEB in the flow through model after ~10 days, whereas complete doxorubicin release was not achieved after 2 weeks. This is in line with a previous in vivo study, where < 50% of the doxorubicin dose contained with DC Beads was found to be released 28 days after implantation in swine liver (Namur et al., 2010). The chemistry of the bead matrix also plays a role in drug release rates, as has been previously demonstrated in comparison of DC Bead and the radiopaque DC Bead LUMI (Hagan et al., 2017; Ashrafi et al., 2017). Despite the drug binding mechanism being theoretically unaltered, the matrix is rendered more hydrophobic and dense by the addition of the radiopaque moiety, reducing the size of the water-filled channels in the hydrogel matrix and impeding transport of drug molecules within the beads. This led to a slower drug release in vitro and a lower plasma Cmax in the swine pharmacokinetic study, which suggests a reduced systemic exposure to the drug. However, it has not yet been determined whether this difference is significant enough to translate into clinically meaningful differences in systemic toxicity. 4.2. Evaluation of the in vitro elution models 4.2.1. VFS model The VFS model allows the reproduction of many phenomena experienced during administration of DEB in the clinic: suspension in contrast agent, gradual (rather than instantaneous) DEB delivery, exposure to high rate pulsatile flow of elution medium, and eventual packing of beads in a confined channel. The presence of these features is a vast improvement in representativeness of the in vivo situation, in comparison to the basic USP type set-ups. This may have been key to having achieved correlation of the elution data with the first 30 min of in vivo plasma concentration data in the case of doxorubicin release from both DEB platforms. For LUMIRI and LUMIVAN the model predicted an earlier Tmax than the in vivo value. However, the dose adjusted Cmax were in a similar range to the in vivo values for all three drugs, suggesting that the model may be useful in predicting the extent of burst release in comparison with other drugs. The accelerated release time course observed in the VFS may simply be a function of the condensed nature of the model. The volume of bead suspension delivered is a tenth of what is used in the swine model, therefore delivery of the entire dose does not take as long, and the channels are blocked quickly as beads reach the filters, leading to the reduction of drug release. Another key difference is that since the VFS is a semi-open loop system, the drug concentration that is recorded at each time point provides a snapshot of what has been released in that moment, in other words the drug does not have the opportunity to accumulate as it would in the plasma prior to the start of elimination. Doxorubicin has a very short distribution half-life of 5 min (Drugbank, 2017), in other words it is quickly distributed into other bodily compartments which is reflected in its early disappearance from the plasma compared to irinotecan and vandetanib. This may be why a better correlation was achieved with doxorubicin in the VFS, where the eluted drug is also quickly removed from the system. 4.2.2. Flow through model The flow through cell model employed in this study mimics packing of beads in blood vessels with a very slow flow rate, which makes it suitable for modelling the mid to late phase of drug release from DEB i.e. post-administration. A number of other drug elution methods have been described in the literature that attempt to model drug release over this phase, including a T-apparatus in which DEBs sit in a well and drug release controlled initially by diffusion in the well followed by more distant convection (Amyot et al., 2002). More recently, a USP Type IV flow-through system was described in which DEBs were placed on top of a column of glass beads that generate a laminar flow regime (Jordan et al., 2010). Each of these methods has its merits but also limitations in terms of practical use and by no means reflect the actual elution kinetics observed in vivo. The flow through system was capable of distinguishing between the three drug types, showing the same pattern as the in vivo data in terms of the relative release rate of irinotecan, vandetanib and doxorubicin as a consequence of drug binding strength, interactions, and solubility. A linear point-to-point correlation was achieved for the first 24 h when comparing the AUC derived from the flow through data and in vivo plasma data for vandetanib. The lack of correlation after 24 h was caused by the drug levels dropping significantly in the swine plasma whilst drug release in vitro continued. This is likely due to the onset of phase 3 drug release in vivo, where blood clotting and stasis has occurred and the beads are firmly embedded in an embolus. Drug diffuses out of the beads and now directly into the surrounding tissue, rather than directly into the blood circulation as can occur during the administration and redistribution phases. The presence of plasma proteins in blood may also contribute to differences in drug release rate in vivo, as adsorption of these proteins into PVA based biomaterials has been documented with unknown effects on drug release. The in vitro elution system therefore is not refined enough to be able to model this biological process. Doxorubicin and irinotecan had differential release rates in the flow through model compared to in vivo, and a point to point IVIVC was not even achieved for these drugs. By convoluting in vitro elution data, it is possible to predict plasma concentrations by mathematical simulation of drug elimination. When this process was applied to our data, the convoluted in vitro profiles only showed similarities in elimination phase curve shape for vandetanib and irinotecan. In contrast to the VFS model, the predicted Tmax were this time several hours later than the actual in vivo Tmax. However, this Fig. 9. Convoluted flow through cell elution data (top row) compared with in vivo plasma concentration (bottom row) for A) LUMIVAN, B) LUMIRI and C) LUMIDOX and comparison of in vitro and in vivo PK parameters (tables inset). A. Hagan, et al. European Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences 136 (2019) 104943 9 can be explained by the fact that the flow through elution process is started with the beads already in an occlusive mass, therefore the burst effect is not modelled and the drug will take longer to reach a peak concentration. FDA guidance states that time-scaling or time shift correction may be applied to the in vitro profile to improve the alignment (FDA, 1997), which has been successfully implemented in developing IVIVC in non-intravenous microsphere formulations using modified USP IV apparatus (Andhariya et al., 2017). Doxorubicin IVIVC was not improved by implementing a simple time shift correction to account for the slow initial release rate, therefore further investigation is required to establish if time-scaling may be appropriate. If the time-scaling factor is found to be non-linear, the lack of consistency between release rates should be treated as a limitation of the in vitro model. Despite using the same volume of beads and drug doses as were used in the in vivo studies, the convoluted profile significantly underestimated the plasma concentrations of all three drugs, although the disparity decreases over time and the values begin to converge after 24 h–48 h. Again, this may be related to the lack of the burst phase and the tight packing and slow flow rate of the system. In particular, doxorubicin was initially very slow to elute from the beads in the flow through model, which may be due to how it is released when packed in a column. Swaine et al. (2016) found that dox release from DC Bead™ in a column was based on a process of drug desorption from the near end of the column, followed by resorption by beads further along in the direction of flow (Swaine et al., 2016). This results in the beads furthest away from the flow source becoming loaded with more drug than the initial loading dose, which may increase drug aggregation and impede ion influx. This effect has resulted in a slow, sustained release of dox in the flow through model, which offset the simulated elimination giving a shallower elimination curve in the convoluted data. In vivo, as previously mentioned dox is quickly distributed into tissues and this is not accounted for in the convolution process. Convolution of in vitro data is one approach to develop an IVIVC, however the method used in this study is traditionally used for either oral or instantaneous i.v. dosage forms, which may mean it is not optimised for controlled release applications. Indeed, a further limitation of our pharmacokinetic studies was restriction of the number of blood samples that could be taken and hence lack of data points for correlation. Reported T1/2 and Vd for the drugs were found to be variable in the literature, and values obtained for humans may not be applicable to swine. Therefore, apparent T1/2 and Vd were obtained from the corresponding DEB pre-clinical studies where possible to improve accuracy. For LUMIDOX they could not be calculated and therefore the parameters were taken from a published study that used i.v. infusion of dox solution in swine rather than DEB, which may limit the accuracy of the prediction, as controlled release formulations can cause apparent T1/2 and Vd to vary from the standard values. A possible alternative approach would be to de-convolute the in vivo data and compare this with the dissolution profiles. 5. Conclusions The models described here have given an insight into how we may start to improve representativeness of in vitro elution testing for drug eluting beads. The early phase VFS model allowed an estimation of the proportion of drug that would be released during the administration phase of DEB-TACE, which can provide an indicator of the relative degree of systemic exposure for different drugs. Vandetanib burst release from LUMIVAN was within a similar range to commonly used drugs irinotecan and doxorubicin, therefore providing encouragement that systemic exposure will remain within acceptably low levels for this novel DEB. The flow through model, as intended, seemed more suited to modelling mid to late phase drug release as it did not predict the early burst effect, but instead corresponded better to the drug elimination phase. It seems that adapting and combining these two methods may offer an improved method of predicting plasma drug concentrations after DEB treatment. Looking forward, it will be of interest to develop a third model based on drug diffusion from DEB into a biomimetic matrix in order to model tissue diffusion, which will complete the picture of the fate of drugs released from embolic beads.

11	2019	Porous poly(ε-caprolactone) implants: A novel strategy for efficient intraocular drug delivery	ABSTRACT This work reports the development of porous poly (ε-caprolactone) (PCL)-based intraocular implants, prepared by green supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) foaming/mixing method (SFM), to produce implants that degrade faster than typical slow-degrading PCL-based implants. The higher porosities and surface areas of these implants led to faster degradation rates at in vitro accelerated alkaline conditions than low porosity/surface area implants prepared by hot melting processing. These porous implants also presented distinct (faster) release rates of a testdrug (dexamethasone). Additionally, these porous devices did not cause cell death and did not reduce the number of neurons, indicating that are not toxic to retinal cells. We further explored the impact of PCL-based implant to the retina by in vivo evaluation and histological analysis. Implants were surgically inserted in the vitreous of Wistar rats, and their presence did not change the function, structure and anatomy of the retina. These devices demonstrated a good intraocular tolerance, further confirming their viability for prolonged drug delivery applications. Further comprehensive studies based on this promising preliminary assessment and proofof-concept could enable its future translation to clinical protective strategies for retinal diseases. 1. Introduction Chronic retinal diseases, as age-related macular degeneration (AMD), glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy, represent 84 % of visual impairment worldwide [1]. The therapeutic options mainly include topical drug administration using eye drops or intravitreal injections [1]. Topical drug delivery is non-invasive and easily performed by the patient [2], however the application of eye drops needs to be quite frequent and leads to poor patient compliance [3–6]. Intravitreal injections are currently the main method to deliver drugs into the posterior segment of the eye [7], however the need to maintain therapeutic drug levels require frequent injections that may cause several side effects such as inflammation, endophthalmitis, retinal detachment and cataracts [8]. Therefore, intraocular drug delivery systems based on biodegradable and biocompatible polymeric materials may have the potential to circumvent some of the aforementioned drawbacks [9–11]. These systems can be designed to maintain the therapeutic concentrations for extended periods, reducing the frequency of administration and increasing patient compliance [11]. The use of biodegradable polymeric drug delivery systems usually overcomes the need of surgical removal after the drug has been exhausted that happens in the case of non-biodegradable implants [11,12]. Poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) is a biocompatible and bioresorbable synthetic polymer approved by US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that has been extensively studied and applied in implants for ophthalmic controlled drug delivery [10,13–15]. In particular, PCL  intraocular implants have been prepared for the delivery of dexamethasone [10,15]. In addition to the controlled delivery of drugs loaded within the matrix, which is mainly controlled by water sorption and by its hydrolytic degradation, PCL presents other important advantages such as its tailorable physical and mechanical properties, and ease of shaping and processing at relatively low temperatures [11,16]. Typical manufacturing techniques used to prepare these polymeric implants are hot melt-pressing (HM), extrusion, 3D-printing, injection moulding or solution casting [9]. However, these methods may involve hazardous solvents and/or operate at processing conditions (e.g., temperature, pH) that could promote the degradation of the polymers, drugs and other additives [9,17]. Alternatively, the supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2)-assisted foaming/mixing (SFM) method can be used to avoid most of these problems. The temporary plasticizing effect of scCO2 leads to operating temperatures considerably lower than typical polymer melting temperatures at atmospheric pressure, thus allowing sensitive drugs to be loaded at mild conditions. In addition, hazardous solvents are usually absent in this method. SFM methodologies have been successfully applied to several thermoplastic polymers, including PCL and other poly(α-esters), to obtain materials with tuneable physical and morphological properties, such as polymer crystallinity, porosity, pore size distributions, pore interconnectivity, and surface area, just by controlling the final depressurization step rate and/or the amount of absorbed CO2 (and varying the other operational conditions such as processing time, temperature and pressure) [17–21]. The typical high porosities introduced in thermoplastic polymers by the SFM process may have the potential to increase the hydrolytic and enzymatic degradation rates of poly(α-esters), namely by increasing surface area, water sorption/swelling rates, and the available reaction sites at the surface, which are quite important advantageous features for slow degrading polymers such as PCL [22,23]. To the best of our knowledge, no porous implant (of the monolithic type) has yet reached the market. However, previous studies suggest that highly porous materials prepared by SFM can be designed for a better control of drug release [17]. Therefore, the present work aimed to use the SFM method to develop and to characterize a new, biodegradable and porous intraocular implant that may present faster degradation rates and, at the same time, still control the release of drugs over time. The morphologies, thermal properties and the degradation kinetics profiles (at accelerated alkaline conditions) of prepared SFM drug-free implants were assessed and compared with non-porous implants prepared by a typical HM process. Additionally, the safety of SFM drug-free implants to the retina was assessed by extended and meticulous in vitro and in vivo studies. Finally, these new implants were tested for the incorporation yields and for the in vitro release kinetics of a test-drug, dexamethasone, a well-known anti-inflammatory and immuno-suppressant glucocorticoid already used for the treatment of ocular pathologies [17,24–26]. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Implants processing PCL pellets (40 k ≤ Mn≤50 kg mol−1 , 48 k ≤ MW≤90 kg mol−1 ; Sigma-Aldrich, Missouri, USA) were processed into powder, as described previously [17], and mechanically sieved (sieve size 0.25 mm) to particle diameters smaller than 250 μm. PCL, dexamethasone (DXMT, ≥98 %; Sigma-Aldrich) and glycofurol (G, 99 %, Sigma-Aldrich), mixtures (in different compositions, Table 1), were introduced into polyurethane micro-cylinder moulds (Optiva® I.V. 24 G catheters, Smiths Medical, Minnesota, USA), and processed by a supercritical carbon dioxide (≥99.998 %, v/v, Praxair, Portugal) foaming/mixing method, at fixed pressure (20 MPa), temperature (45 °C) and processing time (2 h) conditions. Three distinct depressurization rates (1–3 MPa min−1 ) were employed. The employed experimental SFM set-up and the general followed procedures were previously described [17,18]. Additionally, and for comparison purposes, two other PCL-based mixtures (Table 1) were also processed by a two-step HM method: 30 min in an oven (at 1 atm, 50 °C), followed by an additional processing period of 30 min at 80 °C. The processed materials (cylindrical implants) were removed from the micro-cylindric moulds and cut to the desired dimensions (approximately 2 × 0.46 mm, length × diameter) under a stereo microscope (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). Three batches/replicates (using 25–30 moulds/ batch) were prepared for each tested process condition. Typically, 3–4 implants were obtained from each mould. 2.2. Morphological characterization Drug-free implants prepared by SFM and HM were previously sputter-coated with a gold film or with gold/palladium mixture for 15 s (around 4 nm thickness), and analysed in scanning electron microscope (SEM) JSM-5310 (Jeol, Tokyo, Japan) or Vega3 (Tescan, Prague, Czech Republic), respectively, at 2 kV. Processed implants obtained from three different batches (around 25–30 moulds/batch) were analysed (5 measurements) by helium picnometry (AccuPyc® 1330, Micromeritics Instrument Corp., Georgia, USA) to obtain the real densities, by nitrogen adsorption (ASAP 2000, Micromeritics Instrument Corp., Georgia, USA) to determine surface areas (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller, BET) and average pore diameters (Barrett-Joyner-Halenda, BJH), and by mercury intrusion porosimetry (Autopore IV 9500, Micromeritics Instrument Corp., Georgia, USA) to obtain pore size distribution, porosity, bulk density, and average pore diameter. A single set of implants was measured for each process condition; and, the process variability was taken into account by measuring implants prepared from the three different processing batches for each set. 2.3. Thermal properties PCL powder (diameter < 250 μm) and drug-free implants prepared by SFM and HM were analysed by modulated differential scanning calorimetry (MDSC, Q100, TA Instruments, Delaware, USA). Calibration was made with Indium, and tests were performed for samples weighing ∼5 mg, in aluminium pans and under a nitrogen atmosphere (50 cm3 min−1 ), by starting at −80 °C for 5 min, modulating at ± 0.5 °C every 40 s, and heating up to 200 °C at 2 °C min−1 . Assessments were performed in duplicate to obtain the melting temperatures (Tm) and enthalpies (ΔH T f m ( )). The crystallinity degree ( χ (%) c ) was determined by [27,28]: χ = × ΔH T ΔH T (%) ( ) ( ) 100 c f m f f 0 0 (1) where ΔH T( ) f f 0 0 is the melting enthalpy of 100 % crystalline PCL, which is assumed to be 139.3 J g−1 [29]. 2.4. Accelerated alkaline degradation tests The in vitro hydrolysis degradation patterns of drug-free PCL-based implants formulated with glycofurol (PCL:DXMT:G, 92:00:08, wt.%) prepared by SFM and by HM were studied at accelerated alkaline conditions by adapting the method previously developed [29]. Samples of 1.3 mg (3 replicates for each tested processing method) were initially kept immersed overnight in bi-distilled water. Subsequently, samples were immersed in 3 mL of NaOH solution (5 M) (Sigma-Aldrich, Missouri, USA), in sealed glass tubes for 10 min; at room temperature, gently dried in filter paper and weighed to obtain the initial mass (m0). The sealed tubes were kept in a thermoshaker, at 37 °C and 100 rpm, for sample degradation. Samples were removed and weighed (mi) at several defined time intervals. The variation of mass (Δm(%)) was determined by: 2.5. Animals Adult Wistar rats were housed in a standard animal room under controlled environment with free access to food and water. All procedures were approved by the Animal Welfare Committee of the Coimbra Institute for Clinical and Biomedical Research of the Faculty of Medicine of University of Coimbra (ORBEA 23/2015) and were conducted in accordance to the Portuguese law (Decreto-Lei 113/2013) and to the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology statement for animal use. 2.6. Safety for the retinal cells: in vitro experiments 2.6.1. Primary culture of rat retinal neural cells Retinal neural cell cultures were obtained from 3-day-old Wistar rats, as previously described [30]. The cells were plated at a density of 2 × 106 cells cm−2 in 12-well plates with glass coverslips previously coated with poly-D-lysine (0.1 mg mL−1 ; Sigma-Aldrich, Missouri, USA) and cultured in Eagle’s minimum essential medium (Sigma-Aldrich, Missouri, USA), supplemented with 26 mM NaHCO3, 25 mM HEPES, 10 % heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; GIBCO, Invitrogen, Life Technologies, California, USA), penicillin (100 U mL−1 ; Sigma-Aldrich, Missouri, USA), and streptomycin (100 g mL−1 ; Sigma-Aldrich, Missouri, USA) in a humidified atmosphere of 5 % CO2 at 37 °C for seven days. After one day in culture (one day in vitro, DIV1), cell cultures were incubated with PCL-based implants or with medium that was in contact with drug-free implants for 3 weeks (to check for the effects of any PCL degradation products). 2.6.2. Organotypic retinal cultures The retinas from Wistar rats (8–10 weeks old) were dissected in Hanks’ balanced salt solution (HBSS, in mM: 137 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 0.45 KH2PO4, 0.34 Na2HPO4, 4 NaHCO3, and 5 glucose; pH 7.4) and placed in tissue culture inserts with a 0.4 μm pore size (Millicell, Millipore, Massachusetts, USA), with the ganglion cell layer (GCL) facing up. The retinas were cultured for 4 days in Neurobasal-A medium (GIBCO, Invitrogen, Life Technologies, California, USA) supplemented with B27 (GIBCO, Invitrogen, Life Technologies, California, USA), 2 mM L-glutamine (Sigma-Aldrich, Missouri, USA) and gentamicin (50 mg mL−1 ; GIBCO, Invitrogen, Life Technologies, California, USA), in 5 % CO2 humidified atmosphere, as previously described [31]. The cultures were incubated with PCL-based implant for 24 h, 48 h and 72 h or with culture medium that was previously in contact for four weeks with these implants (PCL-based metabolites) for four days. 2.7. Safety for the retina: in vivo experiments 2.7.1. Surgical procedure for implantation of SFM-processed drug-free PCLbased implants The animals were randomly assigned into sham-operated group or implant-inserted group. Animals were anesthetized with 2.5 % isoflurane (IsoFlo; Abbott Laboratories, Illinois, USA) with 1 L min−1 of O2. Oxybuprocaine (4 mg mL−1 , Anestocil, Edol, Portugal) and tropicamide (10 mg mL−1 , Tropicil Top, Edol, Portugal) were applied topically for corneal anesthesia and mydriasis, respectively. One SFM-processed drug-free PCL-based implant (92:00:08, wt.%) was introduced in the vitreous with a 24-gauge catheter after making an incision in the sclera with a 23-gauge needle. Animals were sacrificed 4 and 8 weeks after the surgery. 2.7.2. Measurement of intraocular pressure (IOP) Animals were trained for manipulation for IOP measurement during 2 weeks before surgical procedure. After implantation, IOP was measured bilaterally with a rebound tonometer specifically designed for rodents (Tonolab®, Icare, Finland), twice a week until sacrifice, as previously described [32]. An average of ten reliable measurements made in each eye was considered as one reading and reported as the IOP for that eye. The average of the IOP values obtained during the study interval was reported. 2.7.3. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) Retinal structure was evaluated by OCT using a Micron IV (Phoenix Research Labs, California, USA) with a contact lens specifically designed for rat. The animals were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (90 mg kg−1 ; Nimatek, Dechra, UK) and xylazine (10 mg kg−1 ; Sedaxylan, Dechra, UK). After topical anesthesia with oxybuprocaine (4 mg mL−1 , Anestocil, Edol, Portugal) and pupillary dilation with tropicamide (10 mg mL−1 , Tropicil Top, Edol, Portugal), both eyes were imaged and 13 B-scans centered in the optic nerve head were acquired. Total retinal thickness was obtained after segmentation using the semi-automatic segmentation software InSight (Phoenix Research Labs, California, USA). 2.7.4. Electroretinogram (ERG) recordings Retinal activity was evaluated by electroretinography using corneal gold wire electrodes as previously described [33]. ERGs were performed under red dim light after overnight dark adaptation of the animals. Animals were anesthetized and topical anesthetic and mydriatic were applied, as described above. Methylcellulose (Methocel 2 %, OmniVision, California, USA) was applied for a good contact between cornea and gold ring electrode. A Ganzfeld stimulator (Roland Consult GmbH, Germany) with white light flashes (0.0095–9.49 cd-s m−2 ) was used and scotopic ERG was recorded. The amplitude (μV) and latency (ms) of a-wave and b-wave in  scotopic conditions (reflecting rod response) were extracted. Off-line digital filter was applied on b-wave (high frequency cut-off of 50 Hz) with the RETIport software (Roland Consult GmbH, Germany). 2.8. Immunolabelling 2.8.1. Retinal cell cultures Cell cultures were immunostained as previously described [34]. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, in mM: 137 NaCl, 2.7 KCl, 10 Na2HPO4, 1.8 KH2PO4; pH 7.4) and fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde (PFA) with 4 % sucrose for 10 min. Then, cells were permeabilized with 1 % Triton X-100 and blocked with 3 % bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0.2 % Tween 20. The cells were incubated with the primary antibody (Table 2), followed by incubation with the secondary antibodies (Table 2). The nuclei were stained by incubation with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; 1:2000; Invitrogen, Life Technologies, California, USA) for 10 min. The preparations were mounted with Glycergel mounting medium (DAKO, California, USA) and were observed in a fluorescence microscope (Axio Observer.Z1, Zeiss, Germany). For each condition, 10 images per coverslip were randomly acquired with a 20 × objective (Plan Achromat 20×/ 0.8 M27). In order to compare the different conditions, all images were acquired using identical gain and exposure settings. 2.8.2. Organotypic retinal cultures Retinal organotypic cultures were immunostained as previously described [31]. Briefly, retinas were washed with PBS and fixed with ice-cold 100 % ethanol for 10 min at 4 °C. After washing with PBS, retinas were incubated with blocking solution (3 % BSA, 10 % normal goat serum and 0.1 % Triton X-100) for 1 h at room temperature. Samples were then incubated with the primary antibodies (Table 2) in blocking solution for 48 h at 4 °C, followed by incubation with the secondary antibodies (Table 2) overnight at 4 °C. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (1:1000; Invitrogen, Life Technologies, California, USA) and the samples were then flat-mounted on glass slides with the GCL facing upwards and cover slipped with Glycergel mounting medium (DAKO, California, USA). The preparations were observed in a confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 710, Germany) and images were randomly acquired with a 20× objective (Plan Achromat 20×/0.8 M27). From each retina, 3 images per quadrant were acquired (total of 12 images per sample). All images were acquired using identical gain and exposure settings to compare the different conditions. 2.8.3. Retinal cryosections Retinal cryosections were prepared as previously described [32]. Retinal sections were permeabilized with 0.25 % Triton X-100 in PBS for 30 min and blocked in 10 % normal goat serum plus 1 % BSA in a humidified environment. Then, the sections were incubated with the primary antibodies (Table 2), followed by incubation with respective secondary antibodies (Table 2). Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (1:2000; Invitrogen, Life Technologies, California, USA) and the slices were mounted with Glycergel mounting medium (DAKO, California, USA). The preparations were observed in a confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 710, Germany) and images were acquired with a 20× objective  0 0 (6) MS0 and Mb0 are the fractions of the mass of drug loaded at the surface and at the bulk of the matrix, respectively, with M0 0 = + M M S b0. Incorporated and released DXMT was quantified by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC, Prominence UFLC, Shimadzu, Japan), coupled to a photo diode array detector (DAD, SPD-M20A, Shimadzu, Japan), and using a reverse phase column (Eurospher 100- 5 C18 RP, Knauer, Germany, 250 × 4 mm i.d., 5 mm). The employed chromatographic conditions were described previously [24]. The mobile phase, a mixture of methanol/water (9:1, v/v), was applied at the following conditions: isocratic elution (15 min), and flow rate of 1 mL min−1 at 35 °C. Samples (5 μL) were injected to obtain chromatograms at 239 nm, and acetonitrile runs were used to clean the column between measurements. Calibration curves (R2 = 0.999) were prepared from DXMT solutions of known concentration in methanol (0–45 mg mL−1 , for the drug incorporation experiments), and in water (0–55 μg mL−1 ), for the released experiments. 2.13. Statistical analysis The results are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Statistical analysis was performed with the Prism 5.03 Software for Windows (GraphPad Software, Inc, California, USA). The normality of the data was assessed with Shapiro–Wilk and Kolmogorov–Smirnov normality tests. Accordingly, data were analyzed with parametric and non-parametric tests, depending on the distribution of the data. Drug release data was fitted by non-linear regression model using the JMP Pro 13 software (SAS, USA) to obtain the parameters of the diffusion and desorption models. The root-mean-square error (RMSE) was used to analyze the goodness of fit. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Morphological and thermal characterization Hydrophobic biodegradable polymers are used to obtain ophthalmic implants of several shapes including rods, plugs, pellets, disks and sheets [11,12]. The commonly used hydrophobic polymers for these purposes are poly(lactic acid) (PLA), poly(glycolic acid) (PGA), poly (lactic acid-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) [11,12]. Cylindrical implants with dimensions of around 2 × 0.46 mm (length × diameter) were successfully obtained by SFM and HM processes. Important morphological properties of drug-free PCL-based implants were determined by helium pycnometry, nitrogen adsorption and mercury intrusion (Table 3). Glycofurol (G, also known as tetraglycol, average Mn = 190.24 g mol−1 ) is a safe and FDA-approved excipient in some pharmaceutical formulations (usually used as a hydrotrope). It is relatively non-toxic and non-irritant at the concentrations normally used for pharmaceutical applications, and presents a LD50 of 3.5 mL kg−1 (mouse, intravenous) [41]. In this work, glycofurol was used as a processing agent, namely as a pre-mixing solvent for the drug (DXMT), and as a DXMT-PCL compatibilizer. As expected and as determined by helium pycnometry, HM and SFM-prepared materials presented similar real densities of 1.0–1.2 g cm−3 , which are clearly within the literature values range for pure PCL (0.99–1.22 g cm−3 [42,43]), and showing that the presence of glycofurol (similar density of 1.09 g cm−3 , as provided by the supplier) has a limited effect in real density. The bulk densities of drug-free SFM-processed implants decreased with the depressurization rate from 0.56 g cm−3 (at 1 MPa min−1 ) to 0.38–0.39 g cm−3 (at 2–3 MPa min−1 ). Also, the addition of glycofurol led to a lower bulk density (0.29 g cm−3 ). On the other hand, and as expected, HM-processed implants presented a bulk density of 0.93 g cm−3 , a value that is quite close to the real density, indicating low porosity. Previous studies suggested that varying the final depressurization rate of the SFM-process could allow to control the porosity in PCL samples [19,44]. In this work, the porosity of SFM-processed glycofurol-free PCL implants increased with the depressurization rate (1–3 MPa min−1 ) from 42 to 63 %, following the same trend reported elsewhere [21,45]. After the polymeric matrix swelling by CO2 saturation, a fast decrease in pressure will induce a shift in equilibrium leading to an oversaturation of gaseous CO2 inside the polymeric matrix. Different depressurization rates, at constant temperature, will lead to dissimilar phase separation pathways, and thus to distinct nucleation rates, number of nucleation sites and cavity/bubble sizes, all of which originating final different polymer morphologies, porosities, pore sizes/ diameters, and pore interconnectivities/tortuosities). For faster depressurization rates, the energy barrier for nucleation usually decreases, leading to an increase of the nucleation rate and to the formation of a large number of smaller CO2 bubbles, which will later originate a polymeric matrix presenting a large number of small size/diameter pores (mainly in the micro- and mesoporosity ranges), and high surface areas [46]. On the contrary, for slower depressurization rates, there is more time available for the diffusion of CO2 into the forming bubbles, as well as to bubble coalescence and size growth. As a consequence, polymeric matrices will typically present less pores however of larger pore sizes/diameters and pore interconnectivities [42]. Therefore, as expected, average pore sizes, determined by mercury intrusion (in the 3–150 μm pore diameter measuring range), decreased from 85 to 89 to 52 μm as the depressurization rate was increased from 1 to 2 MPa min−1 to 3 MPa min−1 . For the same depressurization rate (2 MPa min−1 ) and at the same pressure/temperature conditions, adding glycofurol slightly increased the porosity from 57 to 62 %, and decreased the average pore diameter from 89 to 69 μm (Table 3). These results suggest that, at this pore diameter range, glycofurol may also be playing a porogenic role. Unsurprisingly, HM-processed implants presented a much lower porosity (∼13 %) and average pore diameter (∼38 μm). Finally, at this pore diameter range, the average pore diameters obtained by mercury intrusion are in line with what can be observed by SEM (Fig. 1). These porosity/pore diameter differences can range determined by nitrogen adsorption and well above the lower limit of the macroporous region determined by mercury intrusion. These observed distinct initial release profiles were later attenuated as the release period increased, and as the drug deposited on pore surfaces (or nearby) was released, leading to similar DXMT release profiles after 2–3 months, (Fig. 10B). The drug that was released, at these prolonged release periods, should essentially correspond to the DXMT impregnated (i.e., molecularly dispersed) deeper into PCL struts. Moreover, and considering the initial DXMT loaded amounts (Table 1), it can be observed there was still around 35 % of non-released DXMT in the implants after 80 days of release, which suggests that these porous PCL implants can even be used for longer periods of time. The obtained drug release data presented in Fig. 10 was correlated by two non-linear regression models: a diffusion-based model (Eq. (4)) and a desorption-based model (Eqs. (5) and (6)). Correlated parameters are indicated in Table 1. The goodness of fit for both models was confirmed by the relatively small RMSE values. Despite that the diffusion-based model was fitted only to release data points below 40 % of loaded drug, the correlated curves begin to deviate from the HM and SFM experimental points only after 10 and 13 days, respectively, which probably indicates an initial diffusion-controlled release process. HMprocessed implants presented a smaller diffusion coefficient, thus confirming a more sustained kinetics of drug release, if compared with SFM-processed implants, and due to their lower porosities, surface areas and average pore diameters. However, this model should be applied carefully since it does not take into account any of the above referred morphological properties, all them known to strongly affect drug/fluid diffusion from/into solid polymeric matrices. On the contrary, the desorption-based model can help us to infer about sample porosity effects on drug release kinetics. It can be observed that, and using this model, SFM-processed implants presented a higher porosity factor α (0.65) than that obtained for HM-processed implants (0.58), confirming that SFM-processed samples possess a higher fraction of DXMT deposited on pore surfaces, which is more readily available for release. On the other hand, HM-processed implants presented a higher specific process release time (7.5 days) than SFMprocessed implants (3.8 days). This therefore confirms the more sustained DXMT release attained from HM-processed implants: steady state occurred after around 31 days, while it happened after 22 days for the SFM-processed implants. The extended release periods attained for both HM and SFM-based implants were within the range reported for the commercially available Ozurdex implant (30 days) [89]. While Ozurdex releases 100 % of the loaded DXMT (700 μg) over 30 days, the HM- and SFM-processed implants release in this period around 61 % and 66 % of the initially loaded DXMT, respectively. Therefore, and as already discussed, these implants might still release the DMXT that was deeper impregnated in PCL for an additional period of time. In particular, and due to their enhanced porosity and surface area, the potential faster degradation of the SFM-processed implants and the additional DXMT release, can also be a further advantage which could potentially increase the commercial interest of these devices. 4. Conclusions In order to circumvent the adverse effects of multiple intravitreal injections for drug delivery, several types of delivery systems have been proposed. In this work, a new porous PCL-based intraocular implant was successfully developed using a scCO2 foaming/mixing (SFM) method. Glycofurol was used as a processing and compatibilizing agent between PCL and the model drug (DXMT), which led to much higher incorporation yields. The higher surface areas and porosities of SFMprocessed implants led to faster alkaline hydrolytic degradation rates when compared to those implants processed by the conventional HM process. Moreover, these new porous PCL-based implants also presented a faster release rate of the test-drug (DXMT), namely for the initial releasing period, while HM-processed implants present a more sustained release behaviour. These results were confirmed by two release kinetics models (diffusion-based and desorption-based models) The in vitro and in vivo biocompatibility of these new SFM-processed PCL-based implants was assessed. By in vitro studies, we demonstrated that the presence of PCL implants did not increase cell death, as well as, did not decrease the number of neurons in retinal primary neural cell cultures. Moreover, PCL implants did not reduce the number of Brn3aimmunoreactive RGCs in retinal organotypic cultures. By in vivo studies, the presence of PCL-based implants in the vitreous of Wistar rats did not change the values of IOP and did not cause changes in the retinal electrical activity nor in the structure. Moreover, PCL implants did not Fig. 10. Released DXMT (%) from implants (PCL:DXMT:G 66:26:08, wt.%) processed by SFM (◊) and by HM (●) considering hours (A) and days of drug release (B). R.

Nevertheless, both the procedure and the presence of PCL implants may induce Müller cells reactivity, without alterations in microglial cells and astrocytes, but the impact of this to retinal physiology is not known yet. Taking into consideration the lack of retinal toxicity of the new SFM-processed PCL-based implants, we can envisage that these porous intraocular PCL implants can be used for long-term sustained intraocular drug delivery applications in several clinical conditions, thus avoiding the need of repeated intraocular injections. However, further comprehensive studies based on this promising preliminary assessment and proof-of-concept, should be performed in a near future, in order to enable the translation of these devices to the clinics.

12	2019	Efficient lung cancer-targeted drug delivery via a nanoparticle/MSC system	Abstract Low targeting efficiency limits the applications of nanoparticles in cancer therapy. The fact that mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) trapped in the lung after systemic infusion is a disadvantage for cell therapy purposes. Here, we utilized MSC as lung cancer-targeted drug delivery vehicles by loading nanoparticles (NP) with anti-cancer drug. MSC showed a higher drug intake capacity than fibroblasts. In addition, MSC showed predominant lung trapping in both rabbit and monkey. IR-780 dye, a fluorescent probe used to represent docetaxel (DTX) in NP, delivered via MSC accumulated in the lung. Both in vitro MSC/A549 cell experiments and in vivo MSC/lung cancer experiments validated the intercellular transportation of NP between MSC and cancer cells. In vivo assays showed that the MSC/NP/DTX drug delivery system exerted primary tumor inhibition efficiency similar to that of a NP/DTX drug system. Collectively, the MSC/NP drug delivery system is promising for lung-targeted drug delivery for the treatment of lung cancer and other lung-related diseases. 1. Introduction Low targeting efficiency limits the applications of nanoparticles in cancer therapy1–3 . Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have great potential for treating tissue injury and degenerative disease and for use in immune disorder therapy4 . Additionally, anti-tumorigenic effects and low immunogenicity make MSC a kind of ideal vehicle for anti-tumor drug delivery5,6 . While most MSC are trapped in the lung after intravenous administration, which is an unwanted result when MSC are used for cell therapy. Here, we utilized the disadvantage of MSC as an advantage in lung-targeted drug delivery. Even though drug-releasing MSC-mediated inhibition of lung metastasis has previously been described7,8 , more systemic studies are still desired. As a drug delivery vehicle, MSC showed larger NP/DTX intake capacities than fibroblasts. The in vivo distribution of MSC has been extensively studied in mice, but related studies have rarely been performed in larger animals, such as rabbits and monkeys9,10. About 30% of human tumors carry mutation of RAS gene11–13. Of the three genes in this family (composed of K-ras, N-ras and H-ras), K-ras is the most frequently mutated member in human tumors, including adenocarcinomas of the pancreas and lung14,15. KrasG12D mice were used in this study as in vivo tumor model to test tumor inhibit efficiency of the MSC drug delivery system. And MR imaging and Micro-PET-CT was performed to monitor tumor size and metabolism in vivo, respectively. In addition, intracellular processing of NP has been extensively explored, but intercellular transportation has rarely been studied. Here, we established 3D in vitro cell model to prove that NP could be intercellular transported from the MSC to A549 lung cancer cells, which was further supported by the in vivo lung cancer model. There was study showed that mouse bone marrow MSC can be a reservoir for doxorubicin (DOX) and can be released not only in the form of DOX metabolites but also in its original and active form16. Further assay showed MSC efficiently absorb and release paclitaxel (PTX) in an active form. Similar result was observed in DOX and gemcitabine, and all these drug exhibit an inhibitory effect on tongue squamous cell carcinoma cells growth in vitro17,18. While it is still unclear that drug/NP in MSC could be released as an intact form or drug is released only after the NP was destroyed. This desire further evaluation and in this study both in vitro and in vivo models were used to circumvent these questions. This study was designed to get further insight of the efficiency of drug uptake and tumor inhibiting efficiency of the drug/MSC system, and tried to interpret the underlying mechanism. First, this study verified the lung targeting ability of MSC in different animal model. Both in vivo and in vitro studies support the proposed intercellular transportation of NP from MSC to cancer cells. In addition, the MSC/NP/DTX system had tumor inhibition efficiency similar to that of NP/DTX but with only 1/8 the DTX dose. Thus, the MSC/NP drug delivery system is promising for lungtargeted drug delivery for the treatment of lung cancer. MSC may also be useful in lung-targeted drug delivery for chronic pneumonia treatment and other lung related diseases. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Animals The Nu/Nu mice (6–8 weeks old) used for cell and drug in vivo tracing were purchased from Guangdong Medical Laboratory Animal Center, Guangzhou, China. KrasLSL-G12D (KrasG12D) mice (Jaxs mice, Stock No: 008179) carrying a Lox-Stop-Lox (LSL) sequence followed by the K-ras G12D point mutation allele were used as a lung cancer model in this study. To induce lung cancer in KrasG12D mice, 7- to 8-week-old mice received 64 mL of creadvenovirus (AdCre) solution through the nasal cavity. The virus solution was prepared by mixing 30 mL of AdCre (1010 pfu), 70 mL of EMEM, and 0.5 mL of 2 mol/L CaCl2 and placed in room temperature for 20 min. Rabbits (3–4 months old, 3–4 kg, New Zealand white rabbits) were purchased from Guangdong Medical Laboratory Animal Center, Guangzhou, China. The monkey (M. fascicularis, 8 months old, 5 kg) used for in vivo tracing of NP and MSC was purchased from Pearl Laboratory Animal Sci. and Tech. Co. Ltd., Guangzhou, China. The animals were maintained in a temperature-controlled environment (2071 1C) with free access to food and water. All procedures were performed with the approval of the Animal Ethics Committee of Tsinghua University, Beijing, China. 2.2. MR imaging, micro-PET-CT and IVIS spectrum For in vivo tracing of Fe3O4 NP and MSC in the monkey, 1 mL of iron oxide NP suspension (Aladdin Industrial Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China, 5 mg/mL) was mixed in MSC culture medium (1  107 MSC) for 5 h. The MSC were harvested and resuspended in 5 mL of PBS and injected into the monkey via the left arm vein. MR imaging of the monkey was performed at 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 days post-MSC injection. MR imaging of the monkey before MSC injection was used as a blank control. For MR imaging of lung cancer in mice, MSC (1  106 cells carrying NP with 25 mg of DTX) were resuspended in 100 μL of PBS and administered to AdCre-induced KrasG12D mice via intravenous injection. KrasG12D mice without AdCre induction and PBS-treated AdCre/KrasG12D mice served as negative controls, and AdCre/KrasG12D mice receiving DTX (10 mg/kg body weight) in NP were used as the positive control group. T2-weighted MR imaging of the monkey and mice were conducted with a 3 T MRI scanner, with slice thickness (SL) ¼ 1.0 mm, repetition time (TR) ¼ 5000 ms, and echo time (TE) from 10.6 to 159 ms. A micro-PET/CT scan was performed on a SIEMENS Inveon scanner (Siemens Healthiness, Munich, Germany). The clinical package of 18F-FDG (10 mCi) obtained from a regional vendor was diluted to 200 μCi/100 mL for each mouse/injection (200 μCi, 3.7 MBq). The FDG solution was drawn into a 1-mL syringe with a 26G 1/2-inch needle, and the radioactivity of the entire syringe was measured with a dose calibrator. The FDG solution was injected via an intravenous route, the injection time was recorded, and the residual radioactivity of the syringe was measured again with the dose calibrator. The animals were then incubated at room temperature for 1 h for FDG uptake. The injected FDG activity for each mouse was calculated using the following formula: Injected activity (μCi) ¼ activity in syringe before injection – activity in syringe after injection (1) Micro-PET/CT images were reconstructed using a 3D ordered subset expectation maximum (OSEM) algorithm, and CT correction was applied for attenuation correction. In the PET images, ROIs were measured with Inveon Research Workplace (IRW) 3.0 software (Siemens Healthiness, Munich, Germany). The ROI was determined by manually superimposing the ellipsoid volume of interest (VOI) to the target tissue. The activity concentrations were determined by the mean pixel intensity within each VOI and converted to μCi/mL using a    calibration constant. Assuming a tissue density of 1 g/mL, the ROI activity was converted to μCi/g and normalized as percent injected dose per gram (%ID/g). Bioluminescence imaging of luciferase-labeled cell tracing in mice and rabbits and the fluorescence imaging of IR-780-labeled DTX were performed using an IVIS 100 camera (CaliperPerkinElmer). For the cell tracing, IVIS imaging was performed 10 min after intraperitoneal injection of D-luciferin (10 mL/kg) at a concentration of 15 mg/mL in Dulbecco's PBS. For the IR-780- labeled DTX, the fluorescence imaging (excitation at 720 nm, emission at 780 nm) was performed at 3 and 12 h after the drug injection. 2.3. Cell culture, 3D cell spheres and cell imaging Human MSC were isolated from human placenta and cultured as described previously. A549 cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD, USA) and cultured in DMEM (Gibco-Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS (Gibco-Invitrogen) and 1% (v/v) antibiotics (100 units/mL penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin). MSC and A549 cells were seeded on 100-mm culture dishes, and when cells reached 40% confluence, the medium was exchanged with 5 mL of new medium containing 40 mL of 1.0  1010 pfu GFP-adenovirus or Ad-tdTomatoadenovirus or luciferase-adenovirus for 24 h to obtain GFP-MSC, tdTomato-A549 cells, and luciferase-MSC, respectively. Human mammary fibroblasts (HMFs) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% calf serum (CS), 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, and penicillin/ streptomycin. All cultures were maintained at 37 1C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. To form 3D spheroids, passage 5–7 MSC and A549 cells were cultured using a hanging drop method. Briefly, GFP-MSC and tdTomato-A549 cells were mixed at a ratio of 1:2, with a total of 30,000 cells in 35 mL of growth medium per drop were plated in hanging drops and incubated for 36 h to form spheroids. Then, the spheroids were collected to obtain frozen tissue sections and for microscopic analysis. MSC grown on coverslips were fixed in 1% PFA (paraformaldehyde). MSC and A549 cell spheroids were fixed in 3% PFA and embedded in OCT for tissue sectioning (8–10 mm thickness). Nuclei were stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). After mounting, samples were visualized under a confocal microscope (FV1000; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). The 3D cell imaging was performed under an Olympus FluoView FV1000 two-photon microscope with an Olympus 25  1.0 NA water-immersion objective lens. A Spectra Physics Mai-Tai IR laser was tuned to 920 nm for two-photon excitation of GFP and tdTomato. 2.4. Nanoparticle/DTX formation, MSC intake and LC–MS assay Poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA, MW¼10,000), D-α-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (TPGS), N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS), 1,3-diisopropylcarbodiimide (DCC), triethylamine (TEA) and IR-780 were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Docetaxelwas provided by Shanghai Jinhe BioTechnology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX-HCl) was purchased from Dalian Meilun Biology Technology Co., Ltd. (Dalian, China). Methoxy-poly(ethylene glycol)-amine (M-PEG-NH2, MW¼2000) and FITC-poly(ethylene glycol)-amine (FITC-PEG-NH2, MW¼2000) were purchased from Shanghai Yare Biotech, Inc. (Shanghai, China). Cy5-poly (ethylene glycol)-amine (Cy5-PEG-NH2, MW¼2000) was provided by Xi'an ruixi Biological Technology Co., Ltd. (Xi'an, China). All other chemicals and reagents were of the highest quality and were commercially available and used as received. The copolymer PLGA-b-PEG was synthesized as described in our previous report. In brief, PLGA (5.0 g, 0.5 mmol) dissolved in anhydrous dichloromethane was activated by DCC (0.206 g, 1 mmol) and NHS (0.115 g, 1 mmol) at room temperature for 24 h under dry argon. The reaction byproduct dicyclohexylcarbodiurea (DCU) was removed by filtration, and the activated PLGA (PLGA-NHS) was precipitated in anhydrous ether, filtered and washed with methanol. The PLGA-NHS was dried in vacuo at 40 1C for 24 h. The PLGA-NHS (2 g, 0.2 mmol) was dissolved in 25 mL of anhydrous dichloromethane. Then, M-PEG-NH2 (0.5 g, 0.25 mmol) was added to the organic solution under magnetic stirring. The reaction was carried out for 12 h under a dry argon atmosphere, and the resulting solution was precipitated in cold anhydrous ether. The precipitated copolymer PLGA-b-PEG was filtered, washed with methanol, and finally dried under vacuum for 24 h. Moreover, the fluorescence-labeled copolymers PLGA-bPEG-FITC and PLGA-b-PEG-Cy5 were prepared using the same procedure except FITC-PEG-NH2 and Cy5-PEG-NH2, respectively, were used in the reaction instead of M-PEG-NH2. A routine assay for nanoparticle size was performed, the nanoparticle size was ranged from 50–200 nm. The anti-cancer drug DTX-loaded PLGA-b-PEG NP were prepared using a modified nanoprecipitation method as previously described. Briefly, 10 mg of DTX powder and 100 mg of the copolymer PLGA-b-PEG were dissolved in 8 mL of acetone by vortexing. This solution was added dropwise to 100 mL of aqueous solution containing 0.03% TPGS under stirring. The mixture was then stirred uncovered overnight to completely remove the acetone. The NP suspension was centrifuged at 20,000 rpm (Backman, J-30I, CA, USA) for 15 min and then washed three times to remove the emulsifier TPGS and unencapsulated drug. Finally, the resulting product, DTX-loaded PLGA-bPEG NP (designated as NP/DTX), was obtained by lyophilization. IR-780-loaded PLGA-b-PEG NP (designated as NP/IR-780) and fluorescent dye Cy5-labeled drug-free PLGA-b-PEG-Cy5 NP (designated as Cy5-NP) were prepared in a similar manner. For preparation of DOX-loaded PLGA-b-PEG-FITC NP (designated as FITC-NP/DOX), 10 mg of DOX-HCl was neutralized with an excess amount of TEA and 100 mg of the copolymer PLGA-bPEG-FITC were dissolved in 8 ml of acetone. Then, the solution was added dropwise into 100 ml of aqueous solution containing 0.03% TPGS under stirring in the dark. The subsequent procedure was similar to that of the formulation of NP/DTX. The size and size distribution of NP were measured using dynamic light scattering (DLS) with a Malvern Mastersizer 2000 (Zetasizer Nano ZS90, Malvern Instruments Ltd., UK). The morphology of the NP was observed with transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Tecnai G2 20, FEI Company, Hillsboro, Oregon, USA). The prepared NP were approximately 120–130 nm in diameter, which potentially resulted in high cellular uptake through endocytosis. The size distribution and TEM images of NP/DTX are shown in Supporting Information Fig. S1. The NP were nearly spherical and approximately 100 nm in size (smaller than the size obtained using a DLS analysis). This difference can be ascribed to the tendency of NP to shrink and collapse when dried. GFP-MSC and MSC were plated at a density of 4.0  105 cells per 100-mm well in glass-bottomed dishes (MatTek Corporation), when cells reached 80% confluence, the medium was exchanged with 5 mL of new medium containing 100 mL of 2 mg/mL Nano/ DTX. After 3 h, the cells were collected and resuspended in PBS, and 1.0  106 MSC in 100 mL of PBS were injected into mice via the tail vein. LC/MS analysis was performed on a system equipped with an Alliance HPLC Waters 2695 system (Waters, USA) and a Quattro Premier XE mass spectrometer (Waters, USA). The MS system consisted of an ESI interface and a triple quadrupole (QqQ) mass analyzer. The MS parameters were as follows. Capillary voltage was set at 3.0 kV in positive ion mode. Source temperature was maintained at 130 1C, while the desolvation temperature was set at 300 1C. N2 was used as the desolvation gas (flow rate of 800 L/h) and cone gas (flow rate of 60 L/h), and Ar was used as the collision gas (flow rate of 0.15 mL/min). The MS and MS/MS spectra were obtained in MS scan mode and daughter scan mode, respectively. The quantification was performed in multi-reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. 2.5. Western blotting Cell lysates were prepared in a lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholic acid, 2 mmol/L CaCl2 and protease inhibitors (10 μg/mL leupeptin, 10 μg/mL aprotinin, 1.8 mg/mL iodoacetamide and 1 mmol/L phenylmethyl sulfonyl fluoride) and quantified with a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Equal amounts of total protein were subjected to electrophoresis on 12% bis-Tris gels, transblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes and probed with the primary antibody anti-clathrin [D3C6] (1:500, Cell Signal Technology, No. 4796) followed by peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (GeneTex). Immunoreactive bands were detected using an ECL kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Subsequent reprobing using anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was performed as an internal loading control. 2.6. Statistical analyses Results are expressed as the mean 7 SEM unless stated otherwise. Statistical comparisons between two groups were evaluated with Student's t-test (unpaired t-test, two-tailed). A probability (P) value of 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. 3. Results 3.1. MSC have great capacity in nanoparticle/drug intake First, to explore the drug intake capacity of MSC, immunofluorescence (IF) staining was utilized, and extensive NP (PLGA-PEGFITC, the NP was 50–200 nm in diameter and the electron microscope image was showed in Fig. 1a) and doxorubicin (DOX) aggregation was detected 3 h after DOX/NP intake (Fig. 1b). An LC–MS quantitative assay of the DTX dose at 1, 3, 7, 12, and 24 h after MSC intake showed that DTX intake reached a peak at 12 h, with over 36 μg in 106 MSC, compared to only 15 μg of DTX detected in the same number of fibroblasts (Fig. 1c), indicating the high capacity of MSC for NP/DTX intake. This result was further supported by the significantly increased expression of clathrin, an important mediator of endocytosis, in Drug intake capacity of MSC and in vivo distribution of drug, NP and MSC.

These data support that MSC have a great potential in nanoparticle/drug intake. 3.2. MSC are lung-predominant distributed in mice, rabbits and monkey The lung-predominant distribution of MSC in mice was further confirmed with an in vivo imaging system (IVIS) assay, which showed that luciferase-labeled MSC (Luci-MSC) were only detected in the lung 24 h after injection (upper); ex vivo imaging showed similar results (lower) (Fig. 2a). Furthermore, 3D reconstruction imaging of the in vivo distribution of MSC in mice indicated that Luci-MSC uniquely merged in lung position (Fig. 2b). Intravenous injection of Luci-MSC in rabbits revealed that the luciferase signal could only be detected in the lung 12 h after injection, and ex vivo imaging showed a uniform distribution in lung tissue (Fig. 2c). In this study, a cynomolgus monkey was used to further analyze the in vivo distribution of NP and MSC in primates. To detect MSC in monkey, MSC infused with iron oxide (Fe3O4) NP were intravenously injected into the monkey, Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed that Fe3O4 NP signal is extensively detected in the lung on the 1st day after injection, and the MSC in the monkey lung tissue were maintained for approximately 5 days (Fig. 2d). These result proved that MSC are lung-predominant distributed in both small and large animals. 3.3. The duration of MSC and the target of MSC/NP system in vivo Low immunogenicity is a significant feature of allogenic transplantation of MSC. In this study, a comparative assay was performed to study the in vivo duration of MSC. MSC, fibroblast and RAW264.7 cells were equally transfected with Lenti-Luciferase virus, and infused to mice via intravenous injection. The in vivo distribution and tracing  of these cells were assayed by IVIS at 1, 3, 5 and 7 days after cell injection. The result showed that MSC were only detected in the lung area and maintained at least for 7 days, while the fibroblasts and RAW264.7 cells were detected in other tissues and maintained only for approximately 3 days (Fig. 3a). To analyze the in vivo drug distribution of the MSC/NP drug delivery system, IR780 was used for in vivo drug tracing. Briefly, 1  106 MSC carrying NP/IR780 were injected into nude mice, and an IVIS imaging spectrum was obtained 3 and 12 h after injection; regular NP/IR780 were injected as the control group. The results showed that at 3 h after injection the IR780 signal in the lung area in the MSC/NP/IR780 system composed 60% of the whole body signal, and the ratio was 25% for the NP/ IR780 injection. At 12 h, the IR780 signal ratios in the lung area in the MSC/NP/IR780 and NP/IR780 groups were approximately 80% and 20%, respectively (Fig. 3c and d), this result was further supported by ex vivo data of MSC/NP/IR780 distribution in different organ (Fig. 3e). In conclusion, MSC are long-time maintained in vivo, and MSC/NP system could efficiently target the drug to lung tissue. 3.4. Nanoparticles were intercellular transported from MSC to cancer cells in both vitro and in vivo model There are two possible approaches for the transport of the anticancer drug in the MSC/NP system to the lung cancer cells; one approach is the release of the drug from the MSC followed by drug intake by the lung cancer cells, and the other approach is the release of a NP/drug package by MSC followed by the uptake of the NP/drug package by the lung cancer cells. To verify that NP can be transported intercellularly between MSC and lung cancer cells, both in vivo and in vitro studies were performed. For the in vitro study, MSC (GFP-labeled) and A549 (lung cancer cell line, tdTomato-labeled) cells were co-cultured in hanging drop medium to form 3D spheres (Fig. 4a) in which Cy-5-labeled PLGA-PEG NP were carried in MSC. Imaging of 3D sphere sections showed that 36 h after co-culture, the NP diffused dynamically from MSC to A549 cells (Fig. 4b). For the in vivo analysis, GFP-labeled and Cy5-NP-carrying MSC were intravenously injected into Cre-virus induced KrasG12D mice with primary lung cancer. Lung tissue sections revealed that there was also extensive diffusion of NP from MSC to adjacent lung cells (Fig. 4c). These in vivo and in vitro results indicate that dynamic intercellular NP transportation occurred between MSC and cancer cells. 3.5. MSC/NP/DTX system efficiently inhibit tumor growth in vivo To assay the in vivo tumor inhibition efficiency of the MSC/NP/ DTX system, a lung cancer and tumor inhibit model in KrasG12D mice was established (Fig. 5a). In the MSC/NP/DTX group, 1  106 MSC with NP/DTX (MSC) was injected intravenously every 5 days. The NP/DTX group (DTX dose, 10 mg/kg body weight) was also injected at an equal dose into a control group. Thirty days after tumor initiation, a PET-CT assay showed that there was significantly higher 18F-FDG uptake in the lungs of the lung cancer model group. Consistently, an MRI assay showed that there was obvious tumor formation. Comparatively, the PETCT assay did not show notably higher uptake of 18F-FDG in the lungs of the NP/DTX-treated group, and the MRI results showed that there was a small amount of tumor formation. Importantly, in the MSC/NP/DTX-treated group, the PET-CT and MRI showed results similar to those of the NP/DTX group, with  lower 18F-FDG uptake and less tumor formation than the lung cancer model group (Fig. 5b). In addition, tumor weights on the 35th day after primary tumor initiation further confirmed that MSC/NP/DTX and NP/DTX treatment exhibited similar tumor inhibition efficiency (Fig. 5c). The ex vivo assay of the lung tissues (21st day post-Add-Cre induction) from mice in the 4 different groups further validated the tumor inhibition capacity of the MSC/NP/DTX system. The 18F-FDG intake in the MSC/ NP/DTX group was greatly reduced and was quantified as the percent injected dose per gram of tissue (%ID/g) with a decay correction (Po0.001) (Fig. 5d and e). Accordingly, the lung volume in the MSC/NP/DTX group was significantly less than that in the lung cancer group (Po0.001, Fig. 5f). These data indicate efficient in vivo lung tumor inhibition of the MSC/NP/ DTX system. 4. Discussion The promising features of MSC, including their regenerative potential and capacity to differentiate into different cell lineages, have generated great interest of scientists to engage in more studies with intriguing perspectives on cell-based therapies19–21. MSC are the most commonly used adult stem cells in regenerative medicine that can be isolated from several tissues, exhibit a strong capacity for replication in vitro, and can differentiate into osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and adipocytes22–24. Currently, hundreds of MSCbased clinical trials, either complete or ongoing, appear in the database of the US National Institutes of Health25–27. In this study, we tried to utilize MSC as a drug carrier to deliver DTX to lung tumors. There are three obvious advantage for MSC used as lung-targeted drug carrier. Firstly, MSC can be easily isolated and cultured from bone marrow of the patients28, and transplanted into patients again for treatment to avoid immune rejection29. Secondly, it is now well-accepted that MSC exhibit a natural high tumor affinity, which allows them to home to tumors and then retain in tumors in vivo although the detailed mechanism remains unclear30,31. Above all, lung-predominant distribution is the most significant feature of MSC used as lung-targeted drug carrier. In this study, MSC are majorly distributed in lung after intravenous injection in mice, rabbits and monkey. While all the transplanted MSC are xenogenic, thus a systematical study of the in vivo maintenance and tumor inhibit efficiency of an allogenic or autogenic MSC are still desired. The intercellular transportation of nanoparticle between MSC and cancer cells was proved in this study, while the underlying mechanism still need further exploration. Probably, the nanoparticle intercellular transportation was proceeded an exocytosis-endocytosis procedure. In addition, the intercellular transportation efficiency need to be determined with an elegant method. Exosomes also have been exploited as drug delivery vehicles for anti-cancer drugs in several studies, in which exosomes or exosome-like vesicles loaded with Dox or PTX. The chemotherapeutics were shown to traffic to tumor tissues and reduce tumor growth in mice and without the effects that observed mice that treated with free drug32,33. Pascucci et al.17 observed that PTXtreated MSC mediated anti-tumorigenic effects because of their capacity to uptake the drug and subsequently release it in extracellular vesicles. Further assay showed that exosome vesicles fused more effectively with the cancer cell membrane than polymer-based synthetic nanoparticles. Intriguingly, even we observed the intercellular transportation of nanoparticles between MSC and their nearby A549 cells, it still unclear whether this process was mediated by exosomes released by MSC. And it will be interesting to explore the role of exosomes in the intercellular transportation of nanoparticle between different cells. Collectively, this study quantified the DTX intake capacity of MSC and verified the lung targeting ability of MSC, NP and a drug mimic in an MSC/NP drug delivery system. Both in vivo and in vitro studies support the proposed intercellular transportation of NP from MSC to cancer cells. In addition, the MSC/NP/DTX system had tumor inhibition efficiency similar to that of NP/DTX but with only 1/8 the DTX dose. Given the passive lung targeting ability, low immunogenicity and tissue repair-promoting of MSC and the extensive pre-clinical and clinical research basis for application of MSC, MSC may also be useful in lung-targeted drug delivery for chronic pneumonia treatment and other lung related diseases, in addition to being used as a drug carrier for primary and metastatic lung cancer treatment	Xusheng Wanga,† , Haiyan Chenb,† , Xiaowei Zenga,† , Wenpeng Guoc,† , Yu Jinc,† , Shan Wangd , Ruiyun Tiand , Yanjiang Hane , Ling Guof , Jimin Hand , Yaojiong Wub,d,n , Lin Mei
13	2017	The LUTONIX® drug-coated balloon: A novel drug delivery technology for the treatment of vascular disease	abstract  Local drug delivery of an anti-proliferative drug from balloon catheter systems to the site of arterial injury has been attempted repeatedly over the years with limited success in drug uptake and retention. Accessibility of the drug at the site is critical to combat the body's response to the procedural trauma of angioplasty. Recently, formulations have been designed which achieve delivery of therapeutic doses of the anti-proliferative drug paclitaxel to arteries with higher efficiency and longer tissue retention. These formulations succeed through formation of a drug reservoir in the artery wall enabling release after the initial angioplasty procedure. These formulations have become the cornerstone of several drug coated balloon (DCB) technologies which have found an initial, broad therapeutic application in the treatment of stenosis of the superficial femoral artery (SFA). DCBs achieve drug delivery while leaving no implant behind and represent a new class of combination products developed at the interface of engineering, chemistry and medical science. This review article summarizes the development of the LUTONIX® drug coated balloon catheter. The introduction of DCB technology has provided clinicians and patients with new SFA treatment options while ongoing clinical evidence in additional vascular beds is generated. It is well documented that cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death in industrialized nations globally [1]. After coronary artery disease (CAD) and stroke, lower extremity peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is the third leading cause of atherosclerotic vascular morbidity, with the femoropopliteal artery being the most commonly diseased vessel in the peripheral circulation [2,3]. In these patients, restricted blood flow causes symptoms including intermittent claudication, rest pain, and ischemic ulcers that may progress to gangrene and limb loss [4]. The primary mode of treatment for PAD is endovascular balloon angioplasty of the obstruction, the goal of which is to restore luminal diameter and blood flow. However, subsequent restenosis after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) remains too common [5–7]. Local drug delivery by way of drug eluting stents (DES) to reduce the rate of restenosis after percutaneous intervention has shown to be a successful approach for CAD, effectively changing the standard of care for these patients [8–10]. Drug eluting stents have been introduced to improve long-term patency in PAD patients as well [11], although adoption has not been as comprehensive as in CAD patients. The femoropopliteal artery is subject to multidirectional mechanical forces [12]. Therefore, it is well known that stenting may not be ideal due to the potential risk of fracture and deformation [13–15]. Drug coated balloon catheters (DCB) have been developed to achieve long-term patency without leaving an implant behind in an effort to increase durable treatment options available to clinicians. The use of balloon catheters for drug delivery for the treatment of arterial disease has been explored for over 20 years. Devices included drug delivery sleeves that fit over angioplasty catheters, porous balloons that would allow the drug to weep into the vessel wall after inflation, and double balloon systems which after inflation would block the blood vessel at the proximal and distal end allowing the occluded area to be filled with a drug formulation. Various pharmaceutical agents, such as vasodilators, antioxidants, heparin, antiproliferative agents, and gene therapy systems were delivered in preclinical studies, generating poor results [16,17]. Interestingly, Baumbach et al. [18] delivered paclitaxel in porcine hearts with an infusion sleeve system (InfusaSleeve™), and found drug retention of about 2% in the vessel wall post-delivery. The poor efficiency of drug delivery in combination with the cumbersome nature of the devices led to poor adoption. Early literature indicated that coating the balloon portion of a PTA catheter with the antiproliferative drug paclitaxel appeared unable to deliver a therapeutic dose [19]. However, work by Drs. Bruno Scheller and Ulrich Speck indicated that paclitaxel exposed to contrast media (Ultravist™; iopromide) increased the vascular uptake of paclitaxel [20]. This idea was adopted to create a DCB [21], which was coated with a mixture of paclitaxel and iopromide (Paccocath™). The work of Drs. Scheller and Speck postulated that paclitaxel in combination with iopromide results in a formulation that is more effective than paclitaxel alone. In this review, the development and biological performance of a commercially approved paclitaxel formulation, the LUTONIX® DCB coating, are discussed. This system is comprised of a semi-compliant balloon catheter and a coating of paclitaxel, sorbitol and polysorbate with a drug dose density of 2 μg/mm2 . 2. Formulation development The development of a drug coated balloon (DCB) requires exhaustive literature, bench, and preclinical evaluations. In order to efficiently navigate these challenges, the biological response to arterial injury and physiochemical properties of any proposed design must be well understood. There is a necessary distinction of therapy modalities between drug eluting stents and DCBs. The active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) in a DES is combined with a polymer that dictates the rate of release of the drug after stent implantation. The release period of the API from the DES structure is measured in terms of weeks and there is minimal concern for loss of drug during transit to the lesion. In contrast, the API for a DCB is applied to the surface of the balloon in a formulation that should control both retention and release of the API. Furthermore, the release period for the API from a DCB is measured in tens of seconds or minutes; therefore, the efficiency of retention during tracking and subsequent release is critical to ensure therapeutic treatment. Finally, a therapeutic dose of the API delivered from a DCB should be retained by the tissue for a period of time, presenting a unique challenge to the formulation in the absence of a DES-style sustained release polymer system. The list in Table 1, adapted from [22], summarizes requirements for a successful DCB. As with all combination products, the relationship between the catheter device, the drug formulation, and the manufacturing methods should be carefully evaluated. Symptomatic cardiovascular disease is characterized by narrowing of the arteries, resulting in decreased blood flow to downstream tissues. Although necessary to achieve restoration of adequate blood flow, dilation of the stenosis via angioplasty causes substantial injury to the vessel. It has been well recognized that up to 95% of angiographically successful angioplasty procedures result in substantial injury to the treated vessel [23]. The biological response to this injury results in restenosis or renarrowing of the vessel. It has been shown that the severity of the biological response is significantly influenced by the extent of vessel injury during the initial PTA procedure [24]. The acute effects of the angioplasty procedure include denudation of the endothelial layer, compression of plaque and cellular milieu of the lesion, and stretching of the vessel (often including dissection/ separation of the media and adventitia layers) [25]. Denudation of the endothelial layer leads to platelet and fibrin deposition on the vessel surface and the initiation of a complex biological response to the injury. The response is generally characterized by an initial phase of cytokine release, resulting in an inflammatory response including migration of leukocytes from the blood stream to the vessel. The initial inflammatory response peaks over the course of the first 1–3 days [26]. This is followed by a granulation phase, which includes migration of smooth muscle cells from the media into the neointima and hyperplastic proliferation of these cells in the neointima. The proliferative response peaks between 4 and 14 days post-injury, returning to baseline by approximately 28 days [26]. Long-term healing includes regrowth of the endothelial layer, as well as replacement of cellular tissue with extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins such as proteoglycans and collagen. A successful drug coated balloon should reduce the effects of the biochemical and cellular cascade that lead to restenosis in response to injury and healing [16]. (See Fig. 1) Several drugs previously used to prevent arterial restenosis by drug eluting stents were evaluated for use in the LUTONIX® DCB, including sirolimus, sirolimus derivatives, and paclitaxel. Paclitaxel (Fig. 2) was identified as an ideal API to be used in a DCB due to its lipophilicity, potency in inhibiting cellular proliferation, chemical stability, and the overall body of knowledge gained through chemotherapeutic experience and DES development. It is believed that the lipophilicity plays an important role in drug uptake into the tissue. Paclitaxel is a naturally occurring cytotoxic product originally obtained by extraction and successive purifications from select yew tree species (Taxus brevifolia, Taxus yunnanensis, etc.). The mechanism of action for paclitaxel in inhibiting cellular proliferation involves promotion of microtubule formation and inhibiting disassembly of this critical cellular structure during mitosis, arresting the cell in the G2/M phase [25]. Because only a low concentration of drug remains in the artery, to achieve the desired long-term biological effect, the API should remain active at low concentrations. Paclitaxel has been extensively studied in cell cultures to determine the therapeutic range of concentrations. Literature reports of the IC50 of the drug for inhibition of smooth muscle cell proliferation in in-vitro studies is approximately1–2 ng of drug per gram of tissue (ng/g) [27,28], while the IC50 for inhibition of smooth muscle cell migration is approximately 0.4 ng/g [29], indicating the drug is a potent cell migration and proliferation inhibitor at low concentrations. Several suitable additives to paclitaxel were evaluated to generate the uniform coating that adheres to the balloon catheter during handling, but transfers to the vessel wall upon balloon expansion. Excipients were evaluated for their compatibility with paclitaxel, their solubility and chemical properties, as well as their biocompatibility and biodegradation characteristics. Excipients were evaluated from several different chemical classes. These included surfactants (anionic, cationic, non-ionic, and ionic), contrast agents, sugars, oils, lipids, vitamins, amino acids, peptides, proteins, fatty acids, low molecular weight oligomers, urea and mixtures thereof. A formulation which met program goals was ultimately established. In addition to paclitaxel, the drug coating on the LUTONIX® DCB contains the excipients polysorbate, a component of FDA-approved products for IV infusion such as pediatric multivitamins, and the endogenous metabolite sorbitol. These excipients facilitate a uniform coating that adheres to the balloon catheter during handling and, during balloon inflation; these excipients facilitate API release and transfer to target artery tissue. Coating uniformity of the chosen formulation was evaluated by two analytical techniques, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), which are methods described in regulatory guidances for combination products [54]. SEM images demonstrated the coating to be uniformly distributed across the balloon surface. To verify this observation, balloons were sectioned longitudinally and circumferentially, extracted, and tested for paclitaxel content via HPLC. The final LUTONIX® DCB coating was down selected through the use of in vitro and in vivo screening tools to identify the ideal formulation, as well as dose density, with respect to both coating robustness and tissue levels of drug uptake. Published literature has since independently confirmed that a dose of 2 μg/mm2 of paclitaxel effectively inhibits arterial smooth muscle cell proliferation in preclinical models [30–33]. 3. Preclinical evaluation of the LUTONIX® DCB coating The absence of an in-vitro/in-vivo correlation model to replicate the drug delivery, biological activity, and elimination patterns seen in living tissue necessitated the use of animal testing to gain substantial understanding of the system. Preclinical assessment of the LUTONIX® DCB focused on the assessment of systemic and local tissue pharmacokinetics, as well as local and systemic pathological response to the drug dose densities. To fully characterize the effects of the drug, these studies were conducted with DCBs at the final selected dose density (2 μg/mm2 ) as well as an exaggerated dose density to establish a safety margin. The pharmacokinetic (PK) assessment was driven by the need to thoroughly understand the manner in which the API was transferred from the surface of the balloon to the vessel, and residence time of therapeutic drug levels in the tissue. Comprehensive drug effect and safety assessments at both the local and systemic levels were evaluated by key histological considerations for evaluation of localized drug effect and safety which included, but not limited to, endothelial cell coverage, smooth muscle cell loss, fibrin deposition, inflammation, and proteoglycan and collagen deposition. As the transfer of drug to the vessel wall necessitates the release of the drug coating during angioplasty, special attention must also be paid to the biological effect of the formulation in downstream tissues. Current literature suggests that for commercially available DCBs, b20% of the drug loaded onto the catheter is transferred to the vessel wall, with the rest being shed as particulate into vessels downstream of the treatment site [34]. Considerations for preclinical evaluation of systemic and downstream effects were inclusive of, but not limited to, downstream emboli, systemic toxicity, drug-induced vascular changes . Tissue pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetic studies of the LUTONIX® DCB, following GLP protocols, were conducted [33]. The study consisted of treatment with a single clinical dose (1×, 2 μg/mm2 ) for tissue and plasma pharmacokinetic analysis through 180 days. The tissue concentrations (Fig. 3) indicated a bolus delivery of drug followed by an exponential decay in tissue concentration over the course of the study. Arterial paclitaxel concentrations decreased from an initial concentration of 58,800 ng/g at 1 h to 732 ng/g at 60 days and 91 ng/g at 180 days post-DCB treatment. Paclitaxel was detected at 180 days after intervention. The drug level at 180 days could still be in the therapeutic range and provide biological effect [37]. To understand the impact of the clinical procedure on the uptake of the drug by the treated artery, procedural variables were pre-clinically evaluated. The primary mode of action of DCBs is identical to standard PTA; mechanical dilation of the lesion to improve luminal diameter and increase blood flow. Given their similarity, the success of DCB procedures is driven by well-known procedural variables related to standard PTA (Fig. 4). These include proper inflation time, low residual stenosis, and inflation pressure [38]. Procedural variables specific to DCB include transit time to the lesion [39]. Pre-clinical studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of these factors to drug delivery and uptake. In the porcine SFA model, the DCB was introduced through a sheath and delivered to the artery, where the treatment was performed. The amount of time between introduction into the sheath and DCB inflation, called transit time, was varied from 30 s to 3 min. In addition, the length of time the DCB was kept inflated, called inflation time, was varied from 30 s to 3 min. These tests were conducted at 6 sites per treatment arm with an average balloon to vessel ratio (BVR) of approximately 1.3:1. All balloons were inflated to nominal pressure (6 atm). One (1) hour post-DCB delivery, arterial tissues were harvested and processed to measure the amount of drug in each artery. The arterial drug content for each test group was summarized in Fig. 5. Both transit time and inflation time were shown to affect the tissue drug levels post-deployment. Balloon deployment with a 30-second transit time and 3-minute inflation time showed the highest drug concentration in tissue. Conversely, balloon deployment with a 3-minute transit time and 30-second inflation showed the lowest drug concentration in tissue. Short transit times ensure minimal drug loss from the DCB to the delivery site, and prolonged balloon inflations allow for optimal transfer of the formulation to the artery wall. Measured drug concentration in tissue in the long transit, short inflation arm still resulted in therapeutic levels similar to that seen Fig. 3, while optimal results were seen with shorter transit and longer inflation times. In the same porcine animal model, the impact of balloon inflation pressure on drug delivery was evaluated. This study was also conducted with 6 sites per treatment arm, where the balloon inflation pressure was varied from 6 to18 atmospheres, resulting in balloon diameters up to 10% larger than the nominal diameter at the highest pressure studied. Transit time and inflation time were kept constant at 30 s and 30 s, respectively. One (1) hour post-DCB delivery, arterial tissues were harvested and processed to measure the amount of drug in each artery. The arterial drug content for each test group was summarized in Fig. 6. The drug concentration measured in arterial tissue increased with an increase in inflation pressure, reaching a plateau between 12 and 18 atm. Increasing inflation pressure leads to a slight increase in the diameter of the balloon, thus ensuring good contact with the vessel wall clinical dose (2 μg/mm2 paclitaxel), a 4× clinical dose (8 μg/mm2 from 2 overlapping DCBs each with 4 μg/mm2 paclitaxel), or an uncoated control balloon. In this study, the DCBs with 4 μg/mm2 of paclitaxel were manufactured by applying the nominal dose (2 μg/mm2 ) twice and these DCBs were then deployed in an overlapping configuration to deliver 8 μg/mm2 . The treated arteries, downstream vasculature, and organs were assessed histologically at 28, 90, and 180 days post-DCB treatment [33]. The treated arteries showed minimal endothelial loss, fibrin deposition, and inflammation with long-term dose-dependent drug effect (medial smooth muscle cell loss) peaking at 90 days for both 1× and 4× dose (Fig. 7). In parallel, healing of the treated arteries was evident by significantly greater medial proteoglycan and collagen deposition at 180 days. No evidence of ischemia from downstream emboli or systemic toxicity was observed even for the 4× dosage groups. Additionally, the dose dependent response is clearly evident whereby the 4× dose density (8 μg/mm2 ) exhibited higher levels of smooth muscle cell (SMC) loss and collagen deposition in comparison to the 1× dose density. Furthermore, there were no treatment related changes in the non-target organs/tissues (e.g., lung, liver, kidney) for the 1× or 4× dose at any time point. Beyond the summary for these vascular responses, Figs. 8 and 9 illustrate the absence of any physiologically significant vascular changes for both the 1× dose density as well as the 4× at each time point of 28, 90, and 180 days. 3.3. Downstream particulate safety The safety of the particulate shed by the LUTONIX® coating was extensively evaluated using both in-vitro and in-vivo methods in an effort to understand the volume, and biological effect of the coating that may be lost in the bloodstream during the procedure. As described in Section 3.2, extensive histological assessment of downstream and non-target organ tissue was completed during GLP animal studies at both clinical and exaggerated doses to ensure the safety of the particulate generated by the LUTONIX® coating. In addition to the safety and safety margin studies described earlier, an additional study focused specifically on downstream and non-target organ safety was completed at an even higher dosage. Deployment of the DCB in the femoral artery would result in the particulate traveling to the capillary beds in the foot of the animal, possibly resulting in embolic events or vascular tissue reaction to the presence of paclitaxel. Histological assessment of downstream skeletal muscle and the coronary band of each animal, as well as assessment of non-target organs, was completed to evaluate the effects of downstream particulate. Despite the excessive drug particulate exposure in this study, minimal evidence of downstream emboli or drug-induced vascular changes was found in the downstream skeletal muscle and coronary band. Noted pathologic findings included very minimal fibrinoid necrosis with loss of SMCs and inflammation, with collagen replacement of SMCs seen at the 90-day time point. There was no evidence of skeletal muscle infarction or scarring, indicating that the vascular changes observed were minor and likely to be clinically insignificant. These findings were corroborated in a study conducted by Dr. Renu Virmani and the group at CVPath Institute [36]. The femoral arteries of 21 healthy domestic swine were treated with single (1×) or overlapping (3×) inflations of commercially available drug coated balloons (LUTONIX® DCB & IN·PACT™ DCB) and the downstream skeletal muscle and coronary band were evaluated at 28 days and 90 days post-treatment. For the overlapping (3×) LUTONIX® DCB group, no evidence was 3.4. Coating and durability/adhesion A balance is required between adhesion of the coating to the balloon during handling and advancement to the lesion and release of the coating to the vessel upon deployment. Excessive adhesion to the balloon would result in ease of handling and advancement, but inadequate drug delivered to the tissue. Insufficient adhesion would result in a portion of the coating being lost during manufacturing and handling by the physician prior to use and possibly exposure of staff to paclitaxel. The durability of multiple formulations was evaluated in a simulated clinical use study by three independent physicians. The physicians performed all device preparation per the respective device Instructions for Use (IFU) for all steps prior insertion into a patient. During this simulated use test, the amount of paclitaxel material that was lost during this handling was collected, analyzed, and compared to the recommended level of exposure of 1 ng/cm2 [40]for surface contamination of cytotoxic drugs, see Fig. 10. The LUTONIX® formulation consistently showed contamination levels below the recommended level for decontamination [41]. Additional functional testing to quantify drug coating adhesion was completed using samples that were again prepared per the respective IFU while incorporating a “shake” test [31]. This test consisted of measuring the amount of drug coating which fell off a balloon that was inflated and shaken in an empty vial. This representative preparation of the DCB, and subsequent adhesion evaluation, demonstrated that the LUTONIX® formulation consistently exhibited excellent coating durability (Fig. 11) [35,42]. 4. Clinical experience with the LUTONIX® DCB Clinical experience in controlled randomized studies, as well as with real world subjects, is important to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of drug coated balloons. Over 2000 patients have been treated with the LUTONIX® DCB in clinical trials, and key results are summarized in the following sections. 4.1. LEVANT 1 The first human study of LUTONIX® DCB for treatment of occlusive femoropopliteal artery disease was LEVANT 1, a prospective, multicenter, single-blind, randomized (1:1) controlled trial comparing angiographically measured Late Lumen Loss (LLL) with the LUTONIX® DCB to standard (uncoated) balloon angioplasty (PTA) [43]. Enrollment of 101 patients and 24-month follow-up have been completed. Demographic, disease characteristics, and lesion characteristics were well matched between arms. At 6 months, LLL was 58% lower for the LUTONIX® DCB group (0.46 ± 1.13 mm) than for the control group (1.09 ± 1.07 mm; p = 0.016). Composite 24 month major adverse events were 39% for the DCB group versus 46% for PTA group. Pharmacokinetics showed a bi-phasic exponential decay with peak concentration (Cmax) of 59 ng/ml and total observed exposure (AUCall) of 73 ng h/ml. 4.2. LEVANT 2 The LEVANT 2 study was a prospective, multi-center, single-blind, randomized, controlled trial in subjects suffering from obstructive de novo or non-stented restenotic lesions in native femoropopliteal arteries [44]. Four hundred and seventy-six (476) patients were randomized (316 DCB and 160 PTA) at 54 sites in both the United States and Europe [45] under a single protocol. After a defined pre-dilatation, the patients were randomized 2:1 to treatment with the DCB or standard PTA. Patient inclusion and exclusion criteria were similar to LEVANT 1, with a lesion length range of 4–15 cm. Patient demographics, baseline lesion characteristics, and device and procedural success were similar between arms. The study was designed to minimize bias, as patients, clinical events committee (CEC), and core laboratories were blinded to treatment group. Additionally, and unique to date only to this PAD study, a blinded physician performed follow-up clinical evaluations at 30 days, 6 months, and 12 months. Clinical visits with duplex ultrasonography to evaluate restenosis were conducted at 6, 12, and 24 months. At 12 months, the DCB group was shown to be non-inferior to the PTA group in freedom from safety events, defined as freedom from allcause perioperative (≤30 day) death and freedom at 1 year from the following: index limb amputation (above or below the ankle), index limb re-intervention, and index limb-related death (p = 0.005). The proportion of subjects that were free from primary safety events at 12 months was 83.9% and 79.0%, for DCB and PTA, respectively. The DCB group also showed superiority over PTA in primary patency, defined as absence of target lesion restenosis and freedom from target lesion revascularization (65.2% versus 52.6%, p = 0.015). There were no unanticipated adverse device effects in the DCB arm, and overall adverse event rates were similar in the two treatment arms. Freedom from target lesion revascularization (TLR) was a secondary endpoint and was measured at 87.7% for DCB and 83.2% for PTA. The outcomes were numerically fa Among the 476 patients in LEVANT 2, 126 patients were enrolled at 8 participating German sites and were randomized 2:1 to treatment with the LUTONIX® DCB (n = 83) vs an uncoated balloon during PTA (n = 43). Demographic, clinical, and lesion characteristics were matched between LUTONIX® DCB and PTA groups, as were the final percent diameter stenosis (19%) and procedure success (91%). By Kaplan-Meier analysis, the 12-month primary patency rate was 80% vs 58% (p = 0.015) and the composite safety endpoint rate was 94% vs 72% (p = 0.001), respectively. Freedom from TLR was higher for DCBs (96%) vs PTA (82%, p = 0.012). Major adverse events were similar for both groups. Compared to the non-German LEVANT 2 cohort, there was a shorter time between insertion and inflation of treatment balloons (21.8 vs 39.5 s, p b 0.001) in the German cohort. Balloons were inflated to higher pressures (9.0 vs 7.7 atm, p b 0.001) but for a shorter period of time (130 vs 167 s, p b 0.001), and although treated lesions in the German cohort had a higher baseline stenosis, final post-procedure diameter stenosis was lower (19% vs 22%, p = 0.04) than in the non-German patients. Baseline characteristics of treated patients and lesions were generally similar for German and non-German cohorts of LEVANT 2, with a few exceptions that seem unlikely to have impacted the results. Baseline outflow and diameter stenosis were worse in German patients, but lesion length, RVD, occlusions, calcifications, Rutherford category, and ABI were all comparable. Finally, no differences in baseline variables were observed between the DCB and control groups in either the German or the global LEVANT 2 populations. Overall, this sub-group analysis concluded that geographic or regional differences in procedural variables may account for the different outcomes between the German and non-German cohorts. Finally, to better interpret the overall results of LEVANT 2 and the observations in the German cohort, and to provide guidance to clinicians, a post-hoc correlation of 12 month outcomes from the LEVANT 2 clinical study to key procedural variables was conducted [47]. The results suggested correlations between positive clinical outcomes and each of: final residual stenosis, balloon transit time, balloon inflation pressure, and balloon inflation time. As shown in Fig. 12, the 12-month patency rate improved as more of the procedural best practices were applied during drug delivery. In a similar post-hoc analysis, balloon size was also suggested to be correlated with improved outcomes. Specifically, patency outcomes improved by 65.7% over standard PTA when a DCB balloon–to-artery ratio of N1.04:1 was selected. This post-hoc analysis of LEVANT 2 data suggest that these procedural variables are critical for optimal DCB patient outcomes. Rapid transit time to the treatment site ensures minimal drug loss while the catheter is advanced to the lesion. High inflation pressure and longer inflation time ensure that the DCB fully contacts the vessel wall during drug delivery. Full vessel wall contact results in greater drug uptake and higher drug tissue content after the balloon has been withdrawn. After optimal delivery, paclitaxel dwells in tissue for prolonged time periods, and the dissolved paclitaxel from this formulation results in smooth muscle cell inhibition. Successful outcomes using balloon angioplasty require good mechanical dilatation. As the DCB also acts as a PTA catheter, low final percent diameter stenosis is a result of good mechanical dilatation with the catheter. 4.3. LUTONIX® SFA global “real world” registry After commercial release of the LUTONIX® 035 DCB in Europe, a single arm registry study was initiated to evaluate the DCB performance in a “real world” setting. There were a total of 691 subjects enrolled in the Global SFA Registry, across 38 centers and 10 countries. All serious adverse events (SAEs) were adjudicated by a Clinical Events Committee (CEC) and were independently monitored. The patients enrolled in the Global SFA Registry are representative of patients with SFA disease. The patients in this study had longer lesions than what has been previously reported in LEVANT 2 with more advanced disease. The mean lesion length in the Global Registry was longer than LEVANT 2 (101.2 ± 84.2 mm vs. 62.7 ± 41.4 mm) with the maximum lesion length of 500.0 mm vs. 196.7 mm, respectively. The initial percent stenosis was higher for subjects in the Global Registry (90.0% vs. 80.5%). Chronic total occlusions (CTO) were more prevalent in the Global Registry compared to LEVANT 2 (31.2% vs. 20.6%). The primary efficacy endpoint of freedom from TLR at 12 months was higher in the Global SFA Registry as compared to LEVANT 2 with the rate being 93.4% (605/648) vs. 87.7% (250/285). As a secondary endpoint, the 12 month patency rate of the Global SFA Registry was 83.1%. Primary patency was defined as: patency of the target lesion by investigator assessment based on presenting symptoms and clinical exam and by absence of CEC adjudicated TLR event. In the Global Registry good DCB procedures were performed with mean inflation of 108.1 ± 39.49 s, mean inflation pressure of 9.7 ± 2.21 atm, and mean residual stenosis of 14.6 ± 18.69%. Transit time was not collected in the Global Registry [48]. The composite safety outcomes at 12 months were higher (86.8% vs. 83.9%) for the Global Registry as compared to LEVANT 2. Freedom from TLR and safety outcomes at 24 months by Kaplan Meier analysis was 90.3% and 86.7%, respectively [48]. A subgroup of Global Registry subjects with complex lesions including calcified lesions and chronic total occlusion were analyzed. Calcified lesions and chronic total occlusions (CTO) had a Freedom from TLR at 24 months of 88.3% and 89.5%, respectively [49,50]. A long lesion subgroup, from the same study, defined as lesions ≥140 mm in length, was also analyzed. The mean lesion length for this subgroup was 212.3 ± 65.3 mm with a maximum lesion length of 500.0 mm. This subgroup also showed similar results at 24 months; 89.4% Freedom from TLR and 85.7% for composite safety by Kaplan Meier. The Global SFA Registry outcomes further demonstrate the durable benefits and reinforce the safety of the LUTONIX® DCB in real world patients, including those with complex lesions. 4.4. Ongoing investigational device studies At the time of this publication, the LUTONIX® formulation is additionally being studied for safety and efficacy under IDE application in three (3) of the most difficult patient populations with PAD. First, a global randomized trial was initiated to demonstrate the superior efficacy and non-inferior safety of the LUTONIX® DCB in comparison to standard angioplasty for the treatment of stenosis or re-occlusion of below-theknee (BTK) arteries. Patients with BTK [51] disease suffer from a high failure rate with currently available treatments, which may eventually lead to amputation of the limb. Second, a randomized trial is being conducted to demonstrate superior efficacy and non-inferior safety of the LUTONIX® DCB for treatment of in-stent restenosis (ISR) [52] lesions in the SFA in comparison to standard angioplasty. Loss of vessel patency due to the formation of neointimal hyperplasia is a well-documented limitation of stent treatment. As discussed previously, the DCB is designed to prevent smooth muscle proliferation, which is the primary cause of neointimal hyperplasia. Finally, a randomized trial is being conducted that compares the LUTONIX® 035 DCB to the standard PTA for treatment of stenotic obstructions of arteriovenous (AV) fistula [53]. The primary underlying pathophysiologic mechanism responsible for failure of AV fistulas is obstructive lesions due to intimal hyperplasia within the access circuit. 5. Conclusions The development of clinically effective drug coated balloons is attributed to formulations of paclitaxel with excipients that balance durability of the coating to the balloon during handling with release of the coating to the vessel upon deployment. The LUTONIX® drug-coated balloon formulation underwent significant development and optimization using stringent engineering, chemical, biocompatibility and pharmacology requirements. In preclinical studies, the coating balances effectiveness, i.e. drug delivery and drug retention, and safety, i.e. freedom from systemic and downstream toxicity. Extensive clinical trials demonstrated the benefit of this technology for the treatment of obstructive lesions in the SFA, while confirming minimal risks with the addition of the drug in conventional angioplasty. Additionally, through post-hoc analyses, key procedural variables that suggest good drug delivery were identified: final residual stenosis, balloon transit time, balloon inflation pressure, and balloon inflation time. The same formulation is being further studied in additional patient populations and is currently being investigated for safety and effectiveness under IDE for BTK and AV fistula indications.

14	2017	Lysophosphatidic Acid Receptor 4 Activation Augments Drug Delivery in Tumors by Tightening Endothelial Cell-Cell Contact	SUMMARY Vascular normalization in tumors may improve drug delivery and anti-tumor immunity. Angiogenesis inhibitors induce hypoxia, which may facilitate malignant progression; therefore, we investigated other methods to promote vascular maturation. Here, we show that lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) enhances blood flow by promoting fine vascular networks, thereby improving vascular permeability and suppressing tumor growth when combined with anti-cancer drug treatment. Six different G protein-coupled receptors have been identified as LPA receptors (LPA1–6). In studies using mutant mice, we found that LPA4 is involved in vascular network formation. LPA4 activation induces circumferential actin bundling beneath the cell membrane and enhances linear adherens junction formation by VE-cadherin in endothelial cells. Therefore, we conclude that activation of LPA4 is a promising approach for vascular regulation. INTRODUCTION Angiogenesis is a fundamental requirement for tumor growth, and therefore it was widely believed that anti-tumor angiogenesis would be a promising approach to block cancer growth (Bergers and Benjamin, 2003). Accordingly, inhibitors of vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF) and its cognate receptors (VEGFRs) have been developed and utilized clinically. Neutralizing antibody against VEGF (bevacizumab) was the first such approved drug for colon cancer and has been used globally (Ferrara et al., 2004). However, based on the evidence that combination therapy using angiogenic inhibitors and anti-cancer drugs is more effective than monotherapy with either alone, a different concept has emerged, namely, that angiogenic inhibitors in fact normalize immature and leaky blood vessels in the tumor, resulting in improved drug delivery (Jain, 2001). Despite the anticipated benefits of angiogenic inhibitors in cancer therapy, there has been concern that side effects such as hypertension, lung hemorrhage, and renal dysfunction due to vascular damage can be induced by excessive amounts of these drugs. Moreover, hypoxia resulting from blood vessel regression in the tumor causes malignant conversion of cancer cells that facilitates invasion and metastasis (Ebos et al., 2009; Pa` ez-Ribes et al., 2009). Therefore, sustained normalization of the tumor vasculature by methods other than the use of angiogenic inhibitors may enhance effective drug delivery, resulting in improved anti-tumor effects without stimulating malignant behavior of cells in the tumor microenvironment. Gene modification models suggest that homozygous mice lacking Rgs5, a G protein activator expressed on pericytes, or mice heterozygous for proline hydroxylase (PHD2) for stability of hypoxia-inducible factor 1a generate blood vessels in tumors that appear normal (Hamzah et al., 2008; Mazzone et al., 2009). Mice carrying a Sox17 mutation, a molecule crucial for embryonic endoderm formation, also have mature blood vessels in their tumors (Yang et al., 2013). In these mice, it is commonly observed that sustained tumor vessel normalization improves drug delivery and inhibits tumor metastasis, suggesting a benefit of long-lasting tumor vasculature normalization for suppression of malignant progression. Recently, in addition to angiogenic growth factor proteins, such as VEGF, angiopoietin, and platelet-derived growth factor, critical roles of lipid mediators such as lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) have also been documented in vascular formation and integrity (Kono et al., 2004; Yukiura et al., 2011). LPA is generated via several pathways from choline (LPC) by the enzymatic activity of extracellular autotaxin (ATX) having been most extensively analyzed (Aoki et al., 2002). LPA has several functions in cell proliferation, migration, morphological change, and anti-apoptotic effects mediated by its binding to specific receptors (LPA1–6). These are coupled to diverse G proteins such as Gi, G12/13, Gq, and Gs (Yanagida and Ishii, 2011). Knocking out the ATX gene in mice results in embryonic lethality around embryonic day 10.5, accompanied by abnormal blood vessel formation in the yolk sac, placenta, and elsewhere (Tanaka et al., 2006). Moreover, it has been reported that targeted disruption of LPA4 leads to embryonic lethality caused by disorganized blood and lymphatic vessels (Sumida et al., 2010). LPA also has a role in the proliferation of endothelial cells (ECs) (Yin and Watsky, 2005). Therefore, inhibition of LPA and its downstream signaling has gained increased attention as a means to suppress tumor angiogenesis (Su et al., 2013). Contrary to the previous concept, however, here, we show that stimulation via the LPA receptor induces enhanced vascular network formation and improves drug delivery into tumors, resulting in significant anti-tumor effects. RESULTS LPA Promotes Vascular Network Formation in the Tumor When the tumor size reached 30–50 mm3 7–10 days after subcutaneous inoculation of Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells, we initiated treatment by injecting LPA (3 mg/kg) intraperitoneally (i.p.) for 5 days. In the absence of LPA, as expected, blood vessels showed tortuous and discontinuous patterns, especially in the center of the tumor (Figure 1A). In contrast, after LPA administration, larger blood vessels aligned in parallel and fine capillary network formation was induced even in the center of the tumor, furthermore, vessel length was increased in LPA-treated tumors (Figures 1B and 1C). LPA dose-dependently induced vascular network formation, suggesting its direct effects on ECs (Figures S1A and S1B). In order to determine the time course of vascular network formation in these tumors, a single injection of LPA was given to tumor-bearing mice. As shown in Figures 1D and 1E, enhancement of vascular network formation was observed in a time-dependent manner. Expression of the ETS-related gene (ERG), which is normally expressed in ECs (Birdsey et al., 2008, 2015), was observed in elongated ECs in vessels with extended lengths (Figures 1D and 1F). LPA did not increase the number of Ki67-positive nuclei in ERG-positive ECs (Figures S1C and S1D). Pericyte coverage was not significantly altered over 24 hr (Figures S1E and S1F). These data suggest that LPA does not affect proliferation of ECs, but does induce morphological changes, which lead to vascular network formation in tumors. The vascularization-promoting effect of LPA was not only observed in the LLC tumor, but also in colon26 tumors using the same schedule as described in Figure 1A (Figures S1G and S1H). Next, we examined the intraluminal surface of tumor blood vessels by emission scanning electron microscope and found that ECs did not tightly adhere to each other, inter-endothelial gaps were observed, suggesting loose inter-cellular junctions in the lumen of the vessel. However, fewer such inter-endothelial gaps were observed 24 hr after LPA administration, and the surface of the blood vessels from both LLC and colon26 tumors had become smooth (Figures 1G–1I). These effects were induced in all tumors evaluated in our experiments. These are morphological characteristics of mature ECs and have been designated as changes into a ‘‘phalanx’’ phenotype, suggested to reflect tight inter-endothelial junctions and to inhibit tumor metastasis (Mazzone et al., 2009). Accordingly, we investigated whether LPA-induced vascular surface smoothing inhibits tumor metastasis using a model of lung metastases originating from subcutaneous tumors of Ex-3LL (derived from LLC and exhibiting enhanced lung metastasizing ability) or from the highly metastatic melanoma cell line B16BL/6. Both cell lines were engineered to express EGFP. The number of metastases from LPA-treated tumors was significantly lower than from control tumors (Figures 1J, 1K, S1I, and S1J). The metastasis-inhibitory effect of LPA was absent when B16BL/6-EGFP tumor cells were injected directly into the tail vein (Figures S1K and S1L). Therefore, we conclude that LPA not only induces vascular network formation, but also the maturation of these blood vessels possibly by EC-to-cell tightening, and that this reduces metastasis. LPA Promotes Functional Blood Vessel Formation in Tumors We next investigated whether fine capillary network blood vessels in tumors treated with LPA were indeed functionally normal. To assess this, we injected LPA into 30–50 mm3 tumor-bearing mice and, 24 hr later, we injected a lectin that binds to ECs in order to evaluate blood flow and perfusion (Inai et al., 2004; Morikawa et al., 2002). After 10 min in the circulation, this lectin usually labels almost all ECs in normal tissue (Naito et al., 2012) (Figure S2), but in tumors of untreated mice, approximately half the vessels were unmarked, suggesting disturbed perfusion (Figure 2A). However, after injection of LPA, most blood vessels, including those deep inside the tumor, were positive for lectin (Figures 2A and 2B), indicating that blood flow is improved after injection of LPA. Next, we tested changes of drug delivery using doxorubicin, an anti-cancer drug that auto-fluoresces, which was intravenously injected 20 min before tumor dissection. Greater penetration of the drug into tumors was observed in LPA-treated mice (Figures 2C and 2D). This suggests that LPA treatment effectively improves permeability and facilitates access of chemotherapeutic drugs to the tumor. Additionally, we analyzed whether the tissue hypoxia usually observed in the tumor microenvironment was reduced by LPA. For this, we used pimonidazole HCL as a hypoxyprobe 24 hr post-LPA injection. The data indicate that hypoxia was clearly reduced in the tumors of the LPA-injected group (Figures 2E and 2F). Taking all these data together, we conclude that LPA induces functional vascular network formation in tumors. Combination of LPA with Anti-cancer Drug Treatment Effectively Inhibits Tumor Growth Having shown that LPA induces well-organized vascular network formation in tumors with improved functional vascular permeability, we next investigated the therapeutic effects of combining anti-cancer drug treatment with LPA (Figure 3A). We inoculated LLC, B16BL/6 cells, or colon26 subcutaneously and treated the mice from day 6 with either vehicle or LPA (3 mg/kg) daily until Figure 2.

As depicted in Figures 3B–3E, 5-FU alone exerted an anti-tumor effect in each tumor. However, the combination of 5-FU with LPA (LPA/ 5-FU) inhibited tumor growth more markedly. LPA alone tended to inhibit the growth of LLC and B16BL/6 tumors, but not of colon26, although these differences did not achieve statistical significance. In order to test the effect of LPA alone, we evaluated proliferation and apoptosis of subcutaneous LLC tumors. LPA did not affect the number of Ki67-positive cells or terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated 2’-deoxyuridine 5’-triphosphate (dUTP) nick-end labeling (TUNEL)- positive cells (Figures S3A–S3D). The number of cells containing cleaved caspase-3 was slightly, but not significantly, increased in LPA-treated tumors (Figures S3E and S3F). These data suggest that LPA alone does not significantly influence tumor growth. Oxaliplatin (L-OHP; 1.5 mg/kg) has a different mode of action than 5-FU and, when used instead of 5-FU in colon26 tumors together with LPA according to the same treatment schedule, the combination effectively inhibited tumor growth relative to L-OHP alone (Figure S3G). Assessing the quantity of remaining cancer cells by histology after therapy, the amount per whole tumor mass was reduced by 5-FU, however, in tumors treated with a combination of 5-FU and LPA, this reduction was much more marked (Figures 3F–3I). The LPA-Induced Vascular Network Formation in Tumors Is Mediated via LPA4 LPA binds to six different G protein-coupled receptors with seven transmembrane domains (LPA1–6). It has been well-established that cancer cells frequently express LPA1 or LPA3 mice. In addition, improvement of lectin perfusion and dextran extravasation induced by LPA was no longer seen in LPA4/ mice, but the LPA6/ mice were not affected (Figures S4F–S4I). This suggests that LPA4 is the receptor responsible for vascular network formation in tumors. Based on this result, we utilized VPC31144(S), an analog of LPA which preferentially binds LPA4 rather than LPA6 (Yanagida et al., 2013), and studied its effects on blood vessel formation. We found that like LPA, VPC31144(S) also induced vascular network formation in wild-type mice, but that this effect was also absent in LPA4/ mice (Figures 4F and 4G). Moreover, when LLC tumor tissue sections were analyzed, we confirmed that most of the CD31+ ECs were positive for LPA4 at the protein level (Figure 4H). These data confirm that LPA4 is involved in the vascular-promoting effects of LPA. LPA Controls the Cell Membrane Localization of VE-Cadherin Improved vascular permeability and oxygenation suggested that LPA controls vascular EC-cell contact. Therefore, we investigated expression of the adherent junction protein VE-cadherin in the blood vessels of LLC tumors treated as described in Figure 4D. First, we isolated ECs from LLC tumors treated or not treated with LPA. We found that LPA does not enhance VEcadherin mRNA expression (Figure S5A). Next, we performed dual staining of LLC tumor sections with CD31 and VE-cadherin antibodies. In the controls, VE-cadherin was localized in the cytoplasm of ECs and did not merge with EC membrane protein CD31 (Figures 5A and 5B). In contrast, in the LPA-treated tumors, VE-cadherin localized together with CD31 at the cell membrane (Figures 5A and 5C). In order to assess the effect of LPA on the membrane localization of VE-cadherin, we tested commercially available EC lines for LPA receptor expression and selected MS-1, which expressed LPA4 and LPA6 as observed in tumor ECs (Figures S5B and S5C). It is known that VEGF induces internalization of VE-cadherin into the cytoplasm, associated with vascular leakage (Taddei et al., 2008). It has been reported that VEGF-A induces phosphorylation and internalization of VE-cadherin, leading to vascular permeability (Dejana et al., 2008). We hypothesized that LPA affects VE-cadherin phosphorylation in ECs. In MS-1 cells, VE-cadherin was phosphorylated in the absence of VEGF and additional VEGF treatment did not influence this. Moreover, LPA did not affect VE-cadherin phosphorylation in the presence or absence of VEGF (Figure S5D). These results therefore suggest that LPA affects cell-cell junctions of ECs by other mechanisms. It is known that VE-cadherin at the inter-cellular junction lines up with circumferential actin bundles beneath the cell membrane and promotes adherent junction integrity (Noda et al., 2010). We stimulated confluent MS-1 cells with VEGF or LPA, we found that exposure to VEGF alone resulted in decreased amounts of cortical actin fiber at inter-cellular junctions, relative to controls. However, in MS-1 cells, VE-cadherin is already phosphorylated without additional VEGF, explaining why VE-cadherin expression at cell-cell junctions is not altered by this factor. Under these circumstances, however, LPA did result in dose-dependent increases of cortical actin fiber even when stimulated with VEGF, as well as in unstimulated cells. This was accompanied by increased VE-cadherin expression at inter-cellular junctions (Figures 5D–5F and S5E–S5G). Hyper-permeability of blood vessels in the tumor eventually causes interstitial hypertension, resulting in impaired oxygen and drug delivery. Hence, drug delivery into tumors is improved by the restoration of EC barrier function (Carmeliet and Jain, 2011). Because we had shown that LPA promotes VE-cadherin localization to the EC membrane, we asked whether it also enhances barrier function. To do so, we monitored the electrical impedance of monolayers of MS-1 cells using electrical cellsubstrate impedance sensing (ECIS; http://www.nepagene.jp/ index2.html). As depicted in Figures 5G and S5H, treatment with LPA or VPC31144(S) rapidly increased EC barrier function, with a peak effect approximately 60 min after beginning the treatment. Barrier function was continuously maintained for at least 400 min and was increased in a dose-dependent manner by VPC31144(S) and LPA (Figures 5H and S5I). These data suggest that LPA promotes cortical actin fiber amplification and supports membrane localization of VE-cadherin, which leads to tightening of inter-endothelial junctions. LPA4 Signaling Enhances Barrier Function and Network Formation in ECs We showed that tumor vascular formation was promoted by LPA4. In order to determine whether LPA-induced cortical actin fiber amplification and reinforcement of the inter-cellular junctions between MS-1 cells was mediated by LPA4, we blocked the expression of either LPA4 or LPA6 by small interfering RNAs (siLPA4 or siLPA6). Knockdown efficacy was evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR (Figures S6A and S6B). As depicted in Figures 6A–6C, cortical actin fiber formation and VE-cadherin recruitment induced by LPA was prevented by LPA4, but not by LPA6 knockdown. Next, we investigated the effect of LPA4 signaling on primary ECs. We isolated ECs from normal lung of wild-type mice and cultured them on confluent monolayers of OP9 cells. In the control cultures, ECs aggregate together and form a thick network of branches. In contrast, under VPC31144(S) stimulation, ECs form fine networks of branches in a dose-dependent manner (Figures 6D and 6E). This network formation induced by VPC31144(S) was not observed in cultures of primary ECs from LPA4/ mice (Figures 6F and 6G). These data suggest that LPA4 regulates vascular network formation. Analysis of Cell Signaling through LPA4 That Is Required for Barrier Function in ECs First, we hypothesized that Gi is the signal transduction candidate, because Akt activation is involved in the stabilization of ECs, and Gi has been suggested to activate Akt through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) (Ambesi and McKeown-Longo, 2009). Therefore, we utilized the Gi inhibitor pertussis toxin (PTX) (van Corven et al., 1993). PTX itself did not affect barrier function of ECs, however, the VPC31144(S)-mediated increase of barrier function was suppressed by PTX (Figures S7A and S7B). Moreover, VPC31144(S)-induced linear adherence junction formation by VE-cadherin was also perturbed by PTX (Figures 7A–7C). Next, we assessed the involvement of Ga12/13 by silencing GNA13 (siGNA13) (Figure S7C) and found that cortical actin fiber formation induced by VPC31144(S) was inhibited (Figures 7D– 7F). To investigate the involvement of other G proteins, we tested Gs and Gq inhibitors. SQ 22536 and 20 50 -dideoxyadenosine (20 50 DDS) are adenylyl cyclase inhibitors and were used as Gs inhibitors. YM-254890 was used to inhibit Gq. Cortical actin fiber formation induced by VPC31144(S) was observed even under treatment with these inhibitors (Figures S7D–S7F). Thus, we conclude that Gi and Ga12/13 mediate the increased endothelial barrier function resulting from LPA4 signaling. DISCUSSION Here, we show that treatment with LPA converts non-functional blood vessels in tumors into functional vessels with affluent blood flow by inducing fine capillary network formation. Morphological changes of blood vessels caused by LPA are the result of elongation of ECs mediated through LPA4 signaling. LPA4 promotes cortical actin fiber formation of ECs and stabilizes VE-cadherin, which lines up with circumferential actin bundles beneath the cell membrane, which contributes to inter-endothelial tightening, reduces vascular permeability, and facilitates the effects of LPA together with anti-cancer drugs on inhibition of tumor growth. Previously, it was reported that LPA induced vascular permeability in experiments using human umbilical vein ECs (HUVECs) (Yanagida et al., 2009). In contrast, we found that LPA inhibited vascular permeability using MS-1 cells. This difference may be due to the dominant expression of LPA6 rather than LPA4 by HUVECs (data not shown), because we found that the LPA-mediated anti-permeability effect was dependent on LPA4. This suggests that the anti-permeability action of LPA4 outweighs any LPA6-mediated vascular permeability enhancing effect when both LPA4 and LPA6 are expressed by the ECs, as is the case with the MS-1 cell line. The induction of vascular network formation occurs very rapidly after injection of LPA (Figures 1D and 1E). To account for this, it remains possible that LPA may induce proliferation of ECs for network formation. However, considering the usual doubling time of cells and the approximate doubling of vessel length by 24 hr after LPA injection (Figure 1E), it seems unlikely that the mere proliferation of ECs stimulated by LPA could explain this phenomenon. To prove this, we costained LLC tumors with anti-Ki67 and anti-ERG antibodies and showed that LPA did not promote proliferation of ECs. In vitro, we confirmed that LPA did not affect MS-1 cell growth (data not shown). LPA promoted cortical actin fiber formation of MS-1 in 1 hr. Therefore, one possible mechanism responsible for these findings is that rapid cortical actin fiber amplification induced by LPA leads to rapid elongation of ECs and network formation in 24 hr. On the other hand, LPA did stimulate the migration of MS-1 cells (data not shown). This could also contribute to network formation. It has been previously reported that EC network formation is disrupted by VE-cadherin inhibition (Bach et al., 1998). In our study, we found that LPA promotes membrane localization of VE-cadherin in ECs. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that LPA induces network formation by promoting cortical actin fiber formation and following stabilization of VE-cadherin rather than by stimulating their proliferation. It has also been reported that LPA induces proliferation of cancer cells mainly through LPA1 (Tsujiuchi et al., 2014). Therefore, inhibitors for LPA1 have been developed and their effects on tumor growth in mice investigated (Su et al., 2013). LPA1 is involved in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis and systemic sclerosis, and several LPA1 inhibitors have been employed in successful phase I and phase II clinical trials for these diseases (Stoddard and Chun, 2015). An effect on tumor growth inhibition would also be expected. We do not exclude a benefit of those drugs for tumor inhibition, however, we showed here that LPA did not increase the number of Ki67-positive cells in LLC tumors, and that treatment with LPA to improve drug delivery may be clinically effective via LPA4 signaling. Contrary to initial expectations, we found that LPA alone did not induce tumor growth and inhibited LLC and B16BL6 tumors to some extent even without the addition of any anti-cancer drugs. It has been suggested that normalization of the tumor vasculature allows the penetration of leukocytes including CD8+ T cells into the tumor (Huang et al., 2012). Moreover, LPA is itself involved in lymphocyte trafficking (Hata et al., 2016). Therefore, it is possible that LPA treatment improves tumor immunity to inhibit tumor growth, and that combinations of LPA with immunotherapy could be useful, but further analysis is required to determine this. Here, we found that LPA induces membrane localization of VE-cadherin in ECs, mediated via LPA4, which is involved in cortical actin formation via Gi and/or Ga12/13. However, how activation of these two G proteins induces membrane localization of VE-cadherin has not been clearly elucidated. As described above, Gi signaling activates Akt via PI3K (Ambesi and McKeown-Longo, 2009). It is well known that phosphorylation of c-Src activated by VEGFR2 induces phosphorylation of VE-cadherin, resulting in internalization of VE-cadherin into the cytoplasm (Lampugnani et al., 2006). LPA did not affect phosphorylation of VE-cadherin in MS-1 cells (Figure S5D). Angiopoietin-1, a ligand for receptor tyrosine kinase Tie2, induces membrane localization of VE-cadherin through the PI3K-Akt pathway, and it has been determined that Tie2 phosphorylation-driven activation of RhoA leads to an association of Src  with mDia, resulting in sequestration of Src from VEGFR2 and inhibition of VE-cadherin internalization (Gavard et al., 2008). It was reported that Ga12/13 is involved in cortical actin formation of HUVECs via RhoA/ROCK (Yukiura et al., 2015). Therefore, LPA4 activation might be involved in these systems. Further analysis using these inhibitors is required to elucidate the signaling pathway of LPA4 for EC tightening. Previously, signal modification of VEGFR2 by VE-cadherin has been reported; i.e., when VE-cadherin is absent, VEGFR2 phosphorylation is strongly induced, resulting in EC proliferation in an uncontrolled way (Lampugnani et al., 2003). Here, we show that LPA4 activation results in the assembly of circumferential actin bundles beneath the cell membrane, which promotes linear adherence junction formation by VE-cadherin. In the absence of VE-cadherin, EC proliferation stimulated by VEGF is suggested to lead to apoptosis. Hence, uncontrolled VEGFR2 signaling is suppressed by VE-cadherin expression enhanced by LPA and stable and functional blood vessels are induced. Recently, several lines of evidence also indicated the benefits of enhancing maturation of the tumor vasculature by using nonangiogenesis inhibitors, for example, the maturation of blood vessels by increasing the stability of the notch pathway using chloroquine (Maes et al., 2014), normalization of vascular permeability using small amounts of RGD peptide, a synthetic fragment of the integrin binding motif (Wong et al., 2015), or Ang2-binding and Tie2-activating antibody (Park et al., 2016). These agents clearly have a different mode of action from LPA. It is widely accepted that there is a great deal of heterogeneity among cancer cells even in a single lesion, and LPA did not show enhancing effects with anti-cancer drugs when we started treatment of bigger tumors (data not shown). This implies that different angiogenesis disorders may occur simultaneously in the same tumor. Hence, to normalize and mature the blood vessels throughout the whole tumor, a combination of several agents with different mechanisms of action would be desirable. LPA4 agonists are one of these candidates that could be utilized clinically together with other vascular normalization drugs. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Reagents 1-oleoyl-LPA and VPC31144(S) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL) and were dissolved in 50% ethanol at 10 mM, and stocked at 20C. PTX was purchased from List Biological Laboratories (Campbell, CA, USA). SQ22536 (Wako, Osaka, Japan) was dissolved in DMSO at 50 mM and stored at 20C. 20 ,50 -dideoxyadenosine (20 50 DDA; Wako) was dissolved in water at 100 mM and stored at 20C. YM-254890 (Wako) was dissolved in DMSO at 10 mM and stored at 4C. Mice All experiments were performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Osaka University Committee for Animal and Recombinant DNA Experiments. C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice were purchased from SLC (Shizuoka, Japan). LPA4/ mice (Sumida et al., 2010) and LPA6/ mice (Hata et al., 2016) on the C57BL/6 background were produced as described previously. Mice 8 to 12 weeks of age were used for these experiments. Cell Lines LLC (RIKEN Cell Bank, Tsukuba, Japan) was maintained in DMEM (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) (Sigma) and 1% penicillin/ streptomycin (P/S; Life Technologies, Tokyo, Japan). Colon26 (mouse colon carcinoma; RIKEN), B16BL/6 (mouse melanoma, RIKEN), and Ex-3LL (RIKEN) were maintained in RPMI-1640 (Sigma) supplemented with 10% FCS and 1% P/S. MS-1 (mouse pancreatic islet EC line; ATCC) was maintained in DMEM supplemented with 5% FCS and 1% P/S. OP9 (mouse fibroblast; RIKEN) was maintained in MEM (Sigma) supplemented with 10% FCS and 1% P/S. LLC, Ex-3LL, and B16BL/6 cells were stably transfected with the expression vector pEGFP N-1 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The transfected cells were cultured in selection medium containing 200 mg/mL G418 (Geneticin; Gibco, Grand Island, NY). Tumors Subcutaneous xenograft models of LLC and B16BL/6 were established by injecting 1.0 3 106 tumor cells into the flanks of C57BL/6 mice, and colon26 was injected into BALB/c mice. Tumor size was then measured with calipers. Tumor volume (V) was calculated according to the formula V = 1/2 3 length 3 width3 height. For establishment of amodel of metastatic lung tumor spreading from subcutaneous Ex-3LL and B16BL/6 tumors, 1 3 10 6 tumor cells were inoculated into C57BL/6 mice subcutaneously. Mice were treated with vehicle or LPA (3 mg/kg, i.p.) daily from day 7 to day 28. On day 21, subcutaneous tumors were resected, and lungs were harvested on day 42. For establishment of the metastatic lung tumor model of B16BL/6 spreading from intravenous injection, mice were pretreated with vehicle or LPA (3 mg/kg, i.p.) for 7 days, followed by injection of 1 3 105 B16BL6-EGFP cells in 200 mL of PBS into the tail vein. Daily administration of vehicle or LPA continued until 14 days post inoculation. Lungs were dissected on day 21. For evaluation of therapeutic effects of LPA and/or 5-FU (Kyowa Hakko Kirin, Tokyo, Japan) on the tumor, LPA (3 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered daily from day 6 to day 20 and/or 5-FU (100 mg/kg) was given i.p. on day 7 and on day 14. Immunohistochemistry and Immunocytochemistry The procedure for tissue preparation and staining was as previously reported (Naito et al., 2012). Briefly, tumors were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS overnight and were embedded in OCT compound (Sakura Finetek, Tokyo, Japan) and sectioned at 10, 20, 40, or 120 mm. Primary antibodies were rat anti-CD31 monoclonal antibody (mAb) (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA), hamster anti-CD31 mAb (Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany), rabbit antiGFP polyclonal antibody (pAb) (MBL International, Nagoya, Japan), mouse anti-a-SMA-Cy3 mAb (Sigma), rabbit anti-NG2 pAb (Millipore), rabbit antiERG pAb (Cell Signaling Technology Inc., Danvers, MA), mouse anti-Ki67 mAb (Dako, Santa Clara, CA), rabbit anti-Lyve-1 pAb (Reliatech GmbH, Wolfenbuttel, Germany), rabbit anti-cleaved caspase-3 mAb (Cell Signaling Tech- € nology Inc.), and rat anti-VE-cadherin mAb (BD Bioscience), used to stain tumor tissue sections. For immunofluorescence, Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-rat immunoglobulin G (IgG) (Invitrogen), Alexa Fluor 546-conjugated anti-rat IgG (Invitrogen), Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen), Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen), and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-hamster IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) or Cy3-conjugated anti-hamster IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) were used as the secondary antibodies. For immunohistochemistry, biotinylated anti-rat IgG (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) was used as the secondary antibody followed by VECTASTAIN ABC (Vector Labs) and developed by 3,3’-diaminobenzidine (DAB) staining (Dako). To obtain a specific antibody against mouse LPA4, a rabbit was immunized with a synthetic peptide (CEVSDQTTNNGGELMLESTF) derived from the C-terminal region of LPA4 (Sigma). TUNEL staining was performed as described in the manufacturer’s protocol (Takara Bio Inc., Shiga, Japan). For quantification of vascular length, pericyte coverage, Ki67 index, cleaved caspase-3, TUNEL, and H&E staining, sections were dissected at 10 mm thickness and more than three images were taken for each section. For evaluation of vascular length and pericyte coverage, images were taken randomly from tumor center, which was defined as 500 mm inside from the tumor boundary. Quantitative measurement of vessel length was accomplished using a semi-automated computational tool (AngioTool; available in the public domain at https:// ccrod.cancer.gov/confluence/display/ROB2/Home) (Zudaire et al., 2011). MS-1 cells were grown to confluence, serum starved, and stimulated with VEGF (100 ng/mL) with or without LPA (0.1–10 mM). The cells were then fixed with tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-conjugated phalloidin (Sigma). Nuclear staining was performed using Hoechst 33342 (Sigma) or TOPRO3 (Invitrogen). F-actin and VE-cadherin at the cell-cell contact point were measured as previously described (Ando et al., 2013). Briefly, the fluorescence intensity at the cell-cell contact points was measured using the line scan function in MetaMorph (Universal Imaging, Philadelphia, USA). The 3-pixel-width lines were randomly drawn and the mean pixel intensity for each position along the lines was determined by the line scan analysis. The mean fluorescence intensity at the points across the cell-cell contacts was scored as the amount of F-actin and VE-cadherin at the cell-cell contact points. Scanning Electron Microscopy Tissues were fixed with 2% formaldehyde and 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), post-fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide and 0.5% potassium ferrocyanide in the same buffer, dehydrated in graded series of ethanol, substituted with t-butyl alcohol, and freeze dried. After freeze drying, samples were coated with osmium tetroxide and observed with a S-4800 field emission scanning electron microscope (Hitachi High-Technologies Corp., Japan). Assessment of Blood Vessel Function To assess blood perfusion, fluorescein Lycopersicon esculentum (tomato) lectin (0.05 mg/mouse; Vector Labs) was injected intravenously into the tail vein of tumor-bearing mice. 10 min after lectin injection, tumors were dissected. Blood flow was interpreted by the lectin positivity in ECs using 10 mm tissue sections. To evaluate drug delivery, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated dextran (MW 70,000; 0.5 mg/body; Sigma) was injected into the tail vein. 1 hr after injection, intracardiac perfusion with PBS was performed and tumors were harvested. To evaluate anti-cancer drug delivery, doxorubicin hydrochloride (1.5 mg/kg; Nippon Kayaku, Tokyo, Japan) was injected intravenously into the tail vein and allowed to circulate for 20 min. Tumors were collected after intracardiac perfusion with PBS. For evaluation of dextran permeability and doxorubicin delivery, more than three images were taken from tumor center. To measure hypoxia in tumor tissues, Hypoxyprobe-1 (60 mg/kg, i.p.; Hypoxyprobe, Burlington, MA, USA) was injected 2 hr before tissues were harvested. Tumor sections were stained using the anti-Hypoxyprobe antibody, following the manufacturer’s instructions. Samples were visualized using a Leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Nussloch, Germany) or Leica DM5500B and processed with the Leica Application Suite and Adobe Photoshop CS6 software (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA, USA). All images shown are representative of more than five independent experiments. Cell Preparation Tissue dissection procedures and preparation of single cell suspensions were as previously reported (Naito et al., 2016). For cancer cells and EC preparations, LLC-GFP tumors were dissected and stained with phycoerythrin (PE)- conjugated anti-CD45 mAb and allophycocyanin (APC)-conjugated antiCD31 mAb (BD Biosciences). For tumor stromal cell preparation, LLC tumors were dissected and stained with APC-conjugated anti-CD31 mAb (BD Pharmingen), FITC-conjugated anti-CD45 mAb (BD Pharmingen), and biotin-conjugated anti-PDGFRb mAb (Thermo Fisher Scientific K.K., Yokohama, Japan). Streptavidin-PE (BD Pharmingen) was used as the secondary antibody. GFPpositive cancer cells, CD31+ CD45ECs, and CD31CD45PDGFRb+ stromal cells were analyzed and sorted using a SORP FACSAria (BD Biosciences). MACS Cell Separation and Primary EC Culture on OP9 Monolayers Single cell suspensions of normal lung were labeled with APC-conjugated anti-mouse CD31 mAb (BD Pharmingen) and anti-APC MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) and isolated using an AutoMACS (Miltenyi Biotec) cell separator. To confirm the purity of ECs, isolated cells were stained with FITC-conjugated anti-CD45 mAb (BD Pharmingen), and the cell population was analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). We confirmed that >90% of the isolated cells were CD31+ CD45 ECs. ECs were seeded at 3.0 3 105 per well in 24-well plates prepared with confluent OP9 cells. Cells were cultured in minimum essential medium (MEM; Sigma) supplemented with 10% FCS, 1% P/S, and VEGF (20 ng/mL). On day 7, culture medium was changed to new medium containing 10 mM of VPC31144(S) or vehicle. On day 10, culture medium was removed and cells were fixed with 4% PFA in PBS. Biotinylated anti-mouse CD31 mAb (BD Pharmingen) was applied as the primary antibody followed by VECTASTAIN ABC (Vector Labs) and DAB staining (Dako). Real-Time PCR Analysis RNA was extracted using RNeasy Mini Kits (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany), and cDNA was generated using reverse transcriptase with the ExScript RT reagent Kit (Takara, Otsu, Japan). Real-time PCR was performed using a Stratagene Mx3000P (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA). The PCR was performed on cDNA using specific primers with the following sequences: 50 -TGG CAA AGT GGA GAT TGT TGC C-30 and 50 -AAG ATG GTG ATG GGC TTC CCG-30 for GAPDH, 50 -CCG CTT CCA TTT CCC TAT TT-30 and 50 -AAA ACC GTG ATG TGC CTC TC-30 for LPA1, 50 -CCA TCA AAG GCT GGT TCC T-30 and 50 -TCC AAG TCA CAG AGG CAG TG-30 for LPA2, 50 - TTC CAC TTT CCC TTC TAC TAC CTG-30 and 50 -TCC ACA GCA ATA ACC AGC AA-30 for LPA3, 50 -GCC CTC TCT GAT TTG CTT TT-30 and 50 -TCC TCC TGG TCC TGA TGGTA-30 for LPA4, 50 -AGC GAT GAA CTG TGG AAG G-30 and 50 -GCA GGA AGA TGA TGA GAT TGG-30 for LPA5, 50 -TGT GCC CTA CAA CAT CAA CC-30 and 50 -TCA CTT CTT CTA ACC GAC CAG-30 for LPA6, and 50 -AAG TCC ACC TTC CTG AAG CA-30 and 50 -CTT CTC TCG GGC ATC TAC CA-30 for GNA13. Expression level of the target gene was normalized to the GAPDH level in each sample. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting Confluent MS-1 cells were cultured in 6-well plates and serum-starved in DMEM supplemented with 0.5% BSA, after which they were stimulated with 50 ng/mL of VEGF and/or 10 mM of LPA for 30 min. After washing with icecold PBS containing 500 mM of sodium orthovanadate, cells were extracted in TNT buffer (10 mM Tris [pH 7.4], 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP40, 1% Triton, and 2 mM EDTA) containing Halt Protease and Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail (Thermo Scientific). After centrifugation, the supernatants were incubated overnight at 4C with goat polyclonal anti-VE-cadherin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, C-19, sc-6458), and subsequently incubated with Protein G Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (GE Healthcare) for 4 hr. Sepharose beads were washed 34 with TNT buffer and eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer. Analysis by Impedance Measurement by ECIS Barrier function of EC junctions was evaluated using ECIS-zQ (Applied Biophysics, Jordan Road, Troy, NY), as described previously (Ando et al., 2013). In brief, we used 8W10E electrodes with a thin gold film surface and coated each well containing gold film electrodes with collagen so that the MS-1 cells could adhere to them. 4 3 104 MS-1 cells were plated on electrodes and cultured overnight. Each well has a substrate area of 0.8 cm2 and electrode area of 1.96 mm2 . The cells were then starved in 0.1% BSA-containing DMEM for 4 hr and subjected to ECIS. Resistance between cells (Rb) was measured in real time at 37C with 5% CO2 using an ECIS-zQ system at 4,000; 16,000; and 64,000 Hz. MS-1 cells were pretreated for 24 hr with 100 ng/mL PTX to inhibit Gi. siRNA Knockdown siRNAs for LPA4, LPA6, GNA13, and negative control siRNA were purchased from Thermo Fisher and were transfected into MS-1 cells using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Thermo Fisher Scientific), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Knockdown efficiency was verified using quantitative real-time PCR as described above. Statistical Analysis All data are presented as mean ± SEM.

15	2017	A comprehensive screening platform for aerosolizable protein formulations for intranasal and pulmonary drug delivery	ABSTRACT Aerosolized administration of biopharmaceuticals to the airways is a promising route for nasal and pulmonary drug delivery, but − in contrast to small molecules − little is known about the effects of aerosolization on safety and efficacy of biopharmaceuticals. Proteins are sensitive against aerosolization-associated shear stress. Tailored formulations can shield proteins and enhance permeation, but formulation development requires extensive screening approaches. Thus, the aim of this study was to develop a cell-based in vitro technology platform that includes screening of protein quality after aerosolization and transepithelial permeation. For efficient screening, a previously published aerosolization-surrogate assay was used in a design of experiments approach to screen suitable formulations for an IgG and its antigen-binding fragment (Fab) as exemplary biopharmaceuticals. Efficient, dose-controlled aerosol-cell delivery was performed with the ALICE-CLOUD system containing RPMI 2650 epithelial cells at the air-liquid interface. We could demonstrate that our technology platform allows for rapid and efficient screening of formulations consisting of different excipients (here: arginine, cyclodextrin, polysorbate, sorbitol, and trehalose) to minimize aerosolization-induced protein aggregation and maximize permeation through an in vitro epithelial cell barrier. Formulations reduced aggregation of native Fab and IgG relative to vehicle up to 50% and enhanced transepithelial permeation rate up to 2.8-fold. 1. Introduction Drug delivery to the airways using intranasal or inhalative aerosols represents a comfortable and non- to minimally-invasive way of selfadministration. Although these administration routes are well established for small molecules, very little is known about the safe and effective administration of biopharmaceuticals in the airways. Most experience with aerosolized biopharmaceuticals has been gained for the delivery of desoxyribonuclease to the lung for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (Pressler, 2008), cytokines or cytokine agonists for the therapy of asthma (Thipphawong, 2006), but also with inhaled insulin (Siekmeier and Scheuch, 2008). Intranasal delivery with nasal sprays of the peptides desmopressin and calcitonin is well established for over 20 years (Ozsoy et al., 2009). As intransal delivery is also suitable to target the CNS, numerous studies delivered the peptide oxytocin (1 kDa) to treat social disorders (Hurlemann et al., 2010) and likewise the small protein insulin (5.8 kDa) that is able to improve the outcome of some cognitive tasks (Craft et al., 2012; Stützle et al., 2015). However, for larger and more complex proteins such as antibodies only few data are available demonstrating their feasibility as aerosols (Dellamary et al., 2004; Patton and Platz, 1992; Schüle et al., 2008). Depending on aerosol size and inhalation manoeuvre, the aerosolization system allows targeted aerosol deposition in the nasal cavity (Engelhardt et al., 2016), nasal sinuses (Moller et al., 2014) and pulmonary respiratory tract (Coates, 2008). However, generation of micron sized aerosol droplets can have tremendous effects on proteins: complex proteins like monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are very susceptible towards shear and mechanical stress experienced during aerosol formation, which can result in aggregation and unfolding of proteins (Maa and Hsu, 1997; Respaud et al., 2014). For instance, immunoglobulins have hydrophobic domains that can be adsorbed and enriched at the surface of liquid droplets where they interact with gas phase components. As a consequence, proteins are known to unfold, aggregate, degrade and denature (Bosquillon et al., 2004; Couston et al., 2012; Yu et al., 2006) resulting in decreased biological activity and immunological side effects (Rombach-Riegraf et al., 2014). The extent of aggregation is extremely dependent on protein structure, molecular mass, structural motifs, charge and hydrophobicity (Chiti, 2004). Nebulizers are convenient devices for aerosolization of liquid drugs as they provide a moderate continuous flow rate and a constant aerosol size distribution in the optimal range for pulmonary or nasal delivery (Brun et al., 2000). Choosing a nebulizer exerting low shear forces during aerosol generation can reduce aggregation and loss of bioactivity (Andrew and Warren, 2015; Hertel et al., 2015). Likewise, it is well known that protein stability during aerosolization can be further improved by a suitable drug formulation (Shoyele and Slowey, 2006). Even though mAbs share the majority of the sequence in their constant regions, each mAb is unique and needs a tailored formulation (Frokjaer and Otzen, 2005; Wang, 1999; Wang et al., 2007). Interestingly, formulations can additionally have a positive effect on protein permeation through the mucosa and increase thereby bioavailability (Aungst, 2012; Patton and Byron, 2007; van der Lubben et al., 2001). Optimization of formulations consisting of various excipients typically requires systematic testing of a large number and combination of excipients. As nebulization and subsequent sample collection for each of these mixtures is very time consuming, an alternative surrogate method with high throughput capability is desirable. Recently, Hertel et al. (Hertel et al., 2014a) have shown that agitation of protein solutions can be used as surrogate for the stress caused by energy input during nebulization. In a previous study, we have investigated the impact of aerodynamic particle diameter and flow rate on intranasal deposition using a vibrating mesh system (Engelhardt et al., 2016). The purpose of the present study was to develop a comprehensive and fast screening platform for protein aerosols assessing 1) the effect of excipients and formulations on protein stability during aerosolization and 2) the permeation of formulated, aerosolized proteins through an epithelial airway cellular model. For this study, an IgG and its antigen-binding fragment (Fab) were used. The number of required experiments for selection of an optimized formulation consisting of five different excipients is kept at a manageable level by using a previously published aerosolization-surrogate screening method (agitation instead of nebulization) combined with the statistical design of experiments (DoE) tool in a high throughput approach (Hertel et al., 2014a). Subsequently, transepithelial permeation of the best suited drug formulation was determined after aerosolized application onto nasal epithelial cells cultured under physiologic conditions at the air-liquid interface (ALI) using the ALICE-CLOUD aerosol-cell exposure system. 2. Material/Methods 2.1. Proteins The mAb HIRMab 83-14 (designated here as IgG) is an agonistic antibody that binds to and activates the human insulin receptor (Krook et al., 1996; McKern et al., 2006). In ongoing studies, we use this IgG and its Fab as a powerful tool to compare intranasal bioavailability and efficacy of intranasal immunoglubulins with intranasal insulin, which is well described for intranasal delivery (Born et al., 2002; Craft et al., 2013). IgG and its Fab were produced and analyzed as recently described (Röhm et al., 2016). The hybridoma cell line producing this antibody was kindly donated by Ken Siddle (Cambridge University, UK). The antigen of IgG was absent in all studies to avoid interfering effects of antigen binding (data not shown). If not stated otherwise, samples were used at equimolar concentrations of 30 μM (1.4 mg/mL for Fab; 4 mg/mL for IgG). 2.2. Aerosol generator A vibrating mesh nebulizer (Aeroneb Pro, Aerogen Inc., Galway, Ireland) was used in this study. The principles of operation of this device is depicted and described in Fig. 1A. Liquid passing through a vibrating membrane is dispersed into droplets with a mass median aerodynamic diameter of 2.5–6.0 μm. This clinically proven nebulizer is widely used due to its high liquid output rate of 0.3–0.8 mL/min and freely selectable air flow rate (air-less aerosol generation) (Longest et al., 2013). Here, 1 mL of the formulations was nebulized and aerosol droplets were either collected in a 15 mL Falcon tube and analyzed for monomer content or deposited onto epithelial cells for permeability measurements as described below. 2.3. SE-HPLC for the quantification of soluble and sub-visible aggregates Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) was used for the detection and quantification of protein aggregates (Den Engelsman et al., 2011; Mahler et al., 2009). Non-nebulized, nebulized and agitated samples were analyzed using an UltiMate 3000 (Thermo Scientific, Langenselbold, Germany) high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system equipped with a MAbPac™ SEC-1 size exclusion chromatography column (4 × 300 mm) combined with a precolumn MAbPac™ SEC-1 (5 μm, 300 Å, 4 × 50 mm; Thermo Scientific). The quantification of the monomer peak was normalized to a non-nebulized reference and displayed as percentage of monomer recovery [%]. 2.4. Design of experiment (DoE) To determine aggregate formation during nebulization in a small scale and rapid format, agitation was used as surrogate for nebulization as previously described (Hertel et al., 2014a). Briefly, 125 μL/well of formulated protein solution was transferred to a 96-well plate and constantly agitated with 900 rpm for 15 min at 30 °C in an orbital shaker (HLC, Ditabis, Pforzheim, Germany). For identification of an optimized stabilizing formulation, a central-composite-face centered design was used with five factors (excipients), which enables an estimation of linear and quadratic terms as well as first order interactions. (Eriksson, 2008). Three typically used concentration levels for each factor were investigated where the maximum, minimum and centre point concentrations are referred to as 1, −1, and 0, respectively. The investigated excipients were L-arginine, (2-Hydroxypropyl)-β-cyclodextrin (HBC), polysorbate 20 (PS20, Tween® 20), sorbitol, and trehalose (all purchased from Sigma Aldrich, Munich, Germany). The model contained 96 experimental runs (see Supplementary data). Six additional controls were implemented to better constrain the model by setting each factor to zero, while the other factors were held constant at their centre points and one control with all factors at their centre points. Monomer recovery [%] was determined by SE-HPLC as response factors and the data were fitted with the software MODDE 9 (MKS Data Analytics Solutions, Umeå, Sweden). The mathematical model was evaluated using partial-least square regression. Single, quadratic and interaction effects of the excipients were analyzed and non-significant coefficient factors (95% confidence interval includes zero) were removed (displayed in grey in the Supplementary table). The model was fitted until R2 (model fit) and Q2 (model prediction power) were optimal. The results were modelled with a polynomial equation (see  2.5. Cell culture of nasal epithelial cell line RPMI 2650 RPMI 2650 cells, a carcinoma from squamous epithelium obtained from a human nasal septum (Moorhead, 1965), were cultivated in TFlasks with Minimum Essential Medium supplemented by 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS), 1:100 non-essential amino acids, 4 mM L-glutamine and 10 u/mL penicillin (all purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany) and 10 μg/mL streptomycin (Gibco, Darmstadt, Germany) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Throughout this study, 24-well format transwells were used (0.336 cm2 , translucent, 0.4 μm pore size and 1 × 108 /cm2 pore density; Greiner, Frickenhausen, Germany), which were coated with rat-tail collagen (0.05% (v/v); Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany) prior to seeding 2 × 105 cells per insert. 600 μL medium was given to the abluminal (lower) and 100 μL to the luminal (upper) compartment and the cells were cultured for 24 h under submerged conditions and then cultured for additional 24 h at the air-liquid interface (ALI) by removing the luminal medium from the inserts. For immunofluorescence, cells were washed with PBS, fixed with 4% formaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 and blocked with 10% FBS for 1.5 h. Cell staining was performed with anti‐human zona occludens-1 and anti-human E-cadherin (BD biosciences, Oxford, UK) antibodies, which were detected with anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 546 and anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 (Life Technologies, Darmstadt, scalpel and placed onto a microscope slide with cells facing up and mounted with ProLong® Gold Antifade Reagent (Life Technologies). All samples were analyzed with a Zeiss LSM710 (Zeiss, Jena, Germany) confocal laser scanning microscope equipped with a LASOS® Ar-Ion laser. 2.6. ALICE-CLOUD system The ALICE-CLOUD System (Lenz et al., 2014) is a refined verion of the Air-Liquid Interface Cell Exposure (ALICE) system (Lenz et al., 2009) utilizing the unique properties of cloud motion for efficient aerosol-cell delivery. Here, we used the commercially available version, the VITROCELL-CLOUD 12 system (VITROCELL Systems GmbH, Waldkirch, Germany) with adapters for the use of 24-well transwell inserts (Lenz et al., 2014). This system is equipped with an Aeroneb Pro vibrating mesh nebulizer, which generates a dense cloud of aerosol into an exposure chamber containing up to nine 24-well transwell inserts. One of the key performance parameters of the ALICE-CLOUD is the socalled deposition factor, which inidicates the fraction of the “invested” aerosolized drug volume (here 1 mL) deposited on the bottom of the exposure chamber. For no loss of drug, one would expect a deposition factor of unity, i.e. 100% of the “invested” drug deposits on the bottom of the exposure chamber. The deposition factor for each formulation in the ALICE-CLOUD system was experimentally determined for 1 mL vehicle spiked with FITC-dextran (500 μg/mL; Sigma Aldrich) with an average molecular mass of 4.0 kDa. Samples were taken from the wells and the FITC-dextran concentration was determined by fluorescence spectroscopy (excitation/emission at 490 nm/520 nm) using a microplate reader (SpectraMax M5, Molecular Devices LLC., Sunnyvale CA, USA). The deposition factor was determined as previously reported (Lenz et al., 2014) accounting for differences in nebulized volume, area of the wells (3.631 cm2 ) and area of the bottom plate of the exposure chamber (137 cm2 ). 2.7. Determination of permeation across cell layer Permeation experiments were performed both under ALI and submerged cell culture conditions. For the latter, 100 μL of the fluorophore tracer FITC-dextran (500 μg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany) was pipetted onto the transwell insert. Samples were taken from the abluminal compartment and the permeability coefficient (Papp) was calculated as: Papp ( ) = cm s C V AC t Δ[ ] · ·[ ] ·Δ A A L where Δ[ ] C A is the change of the abluminal FITC-dextran concentration at the sampling time (relative to initial conditions of 500 μg/mL), VA is the abluminal volume (100 μL), A is the insert surface (0.336 cm2 ), [C]L is the luminal concentration and Δt is the incubation time. In addition, permeation experiments with aerosolized proteins and aerosolized FITC-dextran were performed with RPMI 2650 cells cultured at the ALI. Prior to aerosolization, cells on transwell inserts were rinsed carefully with Krebs-Ringer-Buffer (KRB, pH 7.4) and transferred to the ALICE-CLOUD system. 1 mL samples of 30 μM formulated proteins or FITC-dextran were nebulized and cells were exposed to the aerosol in the ALICE-CLOUD system. After 90 min or 240 min incubation time, the protein concentration was determined in the abluminal medium by either ELISA or fluorescence spectroscopy, respectively. Permeation of aerosolized proteins or FITC-dextran is displayed either as transport rate⎡ ⎣ ⎤ ⎦ fmol cm s· 2 or as transported fraction [%]. 100% is equal to the average amount of aerosolized protein or FITC-dextran deposited luminally per insert, which was determined as the product of the “invested” drug volume (1 mL), the deposition factor and the cell-covered area per insert (0.336 cm2 ) normalized to the area of the ALICE-CLOUD exposure chamber (137 cm2 ). Direct ELISAs were performed for the quantification of IgG and Fab. Samples and standards were diluted in coating buffer (50 mM carbonate-bicarbonate, pH 9.6) and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in 96-well plates (Brand immunograde, Brand GmbH, Wertheim, Germany). Wells were blocked with 2% (w/v) skim milk powder in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 1 h at RT), incubated with an anti-murine kappa-chain antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (1 μg/mL; 1 h at 37 °C), and 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany) used as substrate for 45 min at room temperature. Absorbance at 640 nm was analyzed with a plate reader (SpectraMax). All washing steps were performed with TBS supplemented with 0.1% Tween® 20. All ELISA assays detect the native protein only (data not shown); hence denatured and aggregated proteins cannot be appropriately detected by the ELISA antibodies. 2.8. Statistical analysis A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and a Bonferroni's Multiple Comparison test was performed to compare the differences between individual groups and an unpaired Student's t-test was applied when comparing two sets of data using GraphPad Prism (Version 5.01, La Jolla, CA, USA). P values of 0.05 were considered to represent a significant difference. All data were expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM) or standard deviation (SD) as indicated. 3. Results 3.1. Screening formulations using a surrogate assay for aerosolization and design of experiment (DoE) The excipients polysorbate 20 (PS20), trehalose, sorbitol, L-arginine, and (2-Hydroxypropyl)-β-cyclodextrin (HBC) were chosen for the formulation screen, since they are known to either prevent surface adsorption of proteins or to have beneficial effects on protein stability. Trehalose and sorbitol are both FDA-approved osmolytes and are reported to improve storage stability and reduce the formation of aggregates (Kamerzell et al., 2011; Maury et al., 2005). L-arginine is known for its solubilizing and refolding potential and to suppress protein–protein interaction, which can lead to the formation of high molecular mass aggregates (Baynes et al., 2005; Tischer et al., 2010). The influence of HBC on enhanced drug absorption and flux was reported by several researchers (Challa et al., 2005; Salem et al., 2009; Serno et al., 2010). Concentration ranges for DoE were chosen according to FDAapproved antibody formulations (Wang et al., 2007). In order to screen protein formulations time- and cost-efficiently, a previously reported surrogate method (Hertel et al., 2014a) was used in a statistical experimental design. We have verified in our lab the validity of agitation as a surrogate for nebulization with a vibrating mesh nebulizer (Fig. 1A) with the above-mentioned excipients (data not shown) and adapted it to a 96-well format with off-line determination of monomer recovery (Fig. 1B). As in our preliminary stability studies, Fab was rather unstable (unpublished data), Fab was chosen as protein to be formulated. For DoE, the five excipients were varied according to their typical individual concentrations in FDA-approved biopharmaceutical drug products as follows: trehalose (0.5 to 6%), sorbitol (0.5 to 5%), L-arginine (0.5 to 5%), PS20 (0.005 to 0.05%) and HBC (0.35 to 3.5%). As centre points for DoE analysis were defined: 3.25% trehalose, 2.75% of both sorbitol and arginine, 0.027 % of PS20 and 1.92% of HBC. All formulations were based on PBS (pH 7.2), denominated as vehicle. Subvisible and soluble aggregates were investigated with SE-HPLC (displayed as % monomer recovery) as response factor. The full DoE approach can be found as Supplementary data. The regression coefficient analysis revealed the impact of the excipients on monomer recovery. Sorbitol and L-arginine were identified as beneficial excipients in the coefficient plots (Fig. 1C). The optimal concentrations of L-arginine were in the range of 2.1 to 5%. for three different formulations (F1–F3, see Table 1) to be further characterized. Since increasing levels of trehalose showed no protective effect, a low concentration of trehalose (1%) was chosen for formulation 1 (F1). However, trehalose is one of the most frequently used protein stabilizers and is reported to preserve the protein’s native conformation particularly under thermic stress that can occur during aerosol generation (Hertel et al., 2014b). Therefore, also higher trehalose concentrations (6%) were tested in F2 and F3. 3.2. Confirming the effect of selected formulations on protein aerosols As the three different formulations (F1-F3) were identified based on a surrogate method for nebulization, they were now tested for their ability to preserve protein stability of Fab and IgG during aerosolization. The formulated protein solutions were nebulized at equimolar concentrations (30 μM) and monomer content was analyzed before and after aerosolization. The non-aerosolized sample was set as 100% monomer content. In the vehicle control, the monomer abundance decreased by roughly 25% and 10% during aerosolization for Fab and IgG, respectively (Fig. 1E and Fig. 1F). In contrast, all formulations showed a stabilizing effect on at least one of the proteins. F1 was the most potent formulation (90.3 ± 2.8% vs. 77.9 ± 1.0% (vehicle); mean ± SEM; n = 2; Fig. 1E) for Fab. It was significantly superior over F2 (Student’s t-test; §§p < 0.01), but failed significance over F3 (p = 0.051). While F3 significantly protected Fab against aggregation relative to vehicle control (**p < 0.002), F2 failed statistical significance as compared to vehicle (p=0.057). For the rather stable IgG, F1 and F2 provided protection with over 95% monomers detected (98.4 ± 1.2% (F1) and 97.3 ± 0.7% (F2) vs. 90.3 ± 2.0% (vehicle); **p < 0.001, for both F1 and F2; Fig. 1F). The effect of F3 on nebulized IgG revealed a tendency but failed statistical significance. These results confirm earlier studies suggesting that the protective effect of formulations is not transferable from one protein to another, even if one protein (Fab) is a derivative of another one (IgG) and shares identical domains (Wang et al., 2007). It is noteworthy that our Fab DoE data using the surrogate indicated that higher levels of sorbitol (F1–F3) combined with lower levels of arginine (F2 and F3) may reduce aggregation more efficiently. However, this could not be confirmed by our aerosolization experiments as all formulations were active and F1 with the highest arginine levels had a tendency to be superior over F2 and F3. 3.3. Establishing an in vitro exposure system for permeation studies with aerosols The nasal epithelial cell line RPMI 2650 is well characterized in the literature and was used in several studies as model for the respiratory epithelium of the nasal cavity and the bronchus (Bai et al., 2008; Kreft et al., 2014; Moore and Sandberg, 1964). Immunoreactivity for cell junction proteins such as tight junctions (zona occludens) and adhesion junctions (E-cadherin) confirmed the formation of a confluent cell layer 48 h after seeding (Fig. 2A–C). The occurrence of cell junction molecules was accompanied by an increase of transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER; data not shown), a good indicator for monolayer integrity (Lehr, 2004). However, as typically observed, TEER values of RPMI 2650 are rather low (50 − 200 Ω × cm2 ) and hence, less conclusive with respect to permeability as compared to other cell lines such as Caco-2 cells (Kreft et al., 2014; Markowska et al., 2001). In addition, FITC-dextran was used as a fluorophore tracer at 125 μM to determine the permeation from the luminal (upper) to the abluminal (lower) compartment of the transwell. Previous studies suggest that cell lines, which are derived from epithelial cells differentiate at the interface to ambient air (ALI), form a tighter barrier than non-differentiated cells (Bai et al., 2008; Gruenert et al., 1995). Accordingly, the Papp values decresed from 1.6 × 10−5 cm/s for submerged cultures to 1.2 × 10−5 cm/s for RPMI 2650 cultured at ALI when seeded at 4 × 105 cells/insert. Although, FITC-dextran permeability observed here was similar to what was reported previously (Hoogstraate et al., 1994; Wengst and Reichl, 2010), it should be noted that RPMI 2650 form a rather loose barrier. In accordance with earlier reports (Bai et al., 2008), we observed slight multi-layer formation occurring at seeding densities of 4 × 105 cells and higher. Hence, 2 × 105 cells/insert were chosen as this resulted in a confluent monolayer after 24 h submerged and 24 h ALI conditions. As mentioned above, the VITROCELL-CLOUD 12 system used in this study is the recently introduced commercial version of the prototype ALICE-CLOUD system presented by Lenz et al. (Lenz et al., 2014). To explore its aerosol delivery performance, the aerosol deposition factor and insert-to-insert variability of the insert-delivered aerosol volume were investigated. The three formulations and the vehicle were spiked with FITC-dextran (125 μM) and 1 mL was nebulized with the vibrating mesh nebulizer positioned at the top of the ALICE-CLOUD system (Fig. 2E). Each formulation was nebulized in triplicates into the exposure system and a total time of 7 min was allowed for nebulization and aerosol settling. This is more than the 3 to 5 min of exposure time used by Lenz et al. (Lenz et al., 2014), since 1 mL instead of 0.2 mL was nebulized here. The deposition factor for each formulation and vehicle was calculated based on the recovered FITC-dextran from the wells (Fig. 2F), normalized to the amount of substance used − the so-called “invested amount” −, taking into account that the wells represent only a fraction of the total area of the bottom inside the exposure chamber. For all protein formulations (F1, F2, and F3), the deposition factor was unity within experimental uncertainties indicating that no significant loss of substance occurred in the ALICE-CLOUD system. For the vehicle, the deposition factor was 16% lower (0.84) and nearly identical to what was reported previously (Lenz et al., 2014). This deviation was accompanied by an about 4-fold higher aerosol output rate as inferred from the shorter nebulization time of just 1 min for the vehicle (1.0 mL/ min) as compared to about 4 min for each volume of F1 to F3 (0.25 mL/ min). This phenomenon, which is probably due to the different viscosity and/or surface tension of formulation versus vehicle (Beck-Broichsitter et al., 2014), can account for the moderate differences in deposition factor. For all four cases, the repeatability (%CV) of the well-delivered aerosol dose for different nebulizations was high (< 5%) and the insertto-insert variability of the well-delivered dose was less than 10% of the mean dose over all wells (5.4% for F1; 3.1% for F2; 6.8% for F3 and 8.3% for vehicle). Hence, in spite of the high output rate of the nebulizer for the vehicle, which leads to a slightly lower deposition efficiency, there was no statistically signficant change in repeatability and spatial uniformity of the aerosol cloud in the ALICE-CLOUD system. These differences in deposition factor, which resulted in slightly different aerosol volumes deposited per 24-well insert (2.44 μL and 2.05 μL for deposition factor of 1.0 (F1-3) and 0.84 (vehicle), respectively), were accounted in the permeability studies described below. 3.4. Influence of protein formulations on transport rates and abluminal recovery To investigate the influence of formulations on transport across the airway epithelial cell line RPMI 2650, 30 μM of IgG, Fab and FITCdextran were prepared in the various formulations and the vehicle. Samples of 1 mL were nebulized and RPMI 2650 cells were exposed to the aerosol in the ALICE-CLOUD system for 7 min. After either 90 min or 240 min incubation the abluminal volume (Fig. 3F) was recovered for protein analysis. For the determination of abluminal recovery as prediction for local protein absorption, SE-HPLC is not suitable as it can hardly distinguish between IgG, Fab and proteins derived from the presence of RPMI 2650 cells. Therefore, IgG and Fab in the abluminal compartment were identified via standardized ELISA that recognizes the Kappa light chain. We have verified that the two ELISAs used here were selective to the native proteins only, i.e. aggregated and/or degraded proteins were not detected (data not shown). Hence, the reported protein transport rates refer to native protein only. However, we cannot rule out a minor disaggregating activity of the ELISA antibodies as observed for therapeutic antibodies (Moreth et al., 2013) that could result in a slight overestimation of the protein concentration. The determined amount of protein was corrected for differences in deposition factor and presented either as transport rate or percentage of protein recovered from the abluminal volume. F1 had a remarkably positive influence on Fab transport and recovery after 240 min incubation: Compared to vehicle, 2.8-times higher levels of native Fab were found in the abluminal volume when F1 was used (Fig. 3A and C, ****p < 0.0001). F2 also revealed a 2.1-fold improved transport rate as compared to vehicle (Fig. 3A, **p < 0.01), while F3 did not significantly alter the transport rate as compared to the vehicle. Although Fab is the proteolytic derivative of IgG, F1 had no significant effect on transport rate of IgG as compared to vehicle (Fig. 3B and D). Instead, F2 and F3 revealed improved transport rates of the native IgG protein (1.8-fold for F2, ***p < 0.001 and 1.4-fold for F3, **p < 0.01) as compared to vehicle. F1 and vehicle were additionally investigated after 90 min of incubation and displayed in Fig. 3C-D as percentage of protein transported to the abluminal compartment relative to the total deposited protein per well. F1 demonstrated a time-dependent increase on Fab transport (Fig. 3C), but no effect at all on IgG transport (Fig. 3D). In Fig. 3E the transport rates for the formulations with the strongest effect on permeation for each of the proteins are displayed, i.e. F1 for Fab and F2 for IgG are plotted against the protein’s molecular mass (mM). FITCdextran (4 kDa) was used in F1 and vehicle as control for effects associated with permeability and not with stability. As expected for diffusion-driven processes, the transport rate increases with lower molecular mass according to a power law relationship (∼mM −b ; bvehicle = −0.62; bformulation = −0.38). A potential positive bias on protein transport rates may have been arisen from inadvertent excipient-induced membrane permeabilization as reported for e.g. HBC (Fujii et al., 2013; Loftsson et al., 2005; Sintov et al., 2010; Tiwari et al., 2010) at concentrations of 20% in nasal epithelium (Abe et al., 1995). As seen from Fig. 3E this effect was negligible in the present study, since there was no significant effect of formulation F1 (HBC concentration below 1%) on FITC-dextran transport rates. This indicates that HBC and all other excipients had apparently no effect on tight junctions or permeability at the concentrations used in F1. Hence, it is likely that the observed increased abluminal protein recovery is predominantly due to formulation-induced protein protection during nebulization and subsequent barrier permeation, since denatured or aggregated proteins were not detected by ELISA. The protective effect during barrier penetration is evident from the enhanced abluminal protein recovery as compared to monomer recovery after nebulization (Fig. 1E and F). 4. Discussion Aerosolized drug administration offers a broad application spectrum for the treatment of different pulmonary and systemic diseases (inhalation (Darquenne et al., 2016)) but also of neurological disease such as neurodegeneration (intranasal (de la Monte, 2013)). Several medical devices can be expected to reach the market in the near future (Touitou and Illum, 2013). Currently, a wide variety of small molecule drugs are clinically available, but the development of aerosolizable biopharmaceuticals peptides, proteins and cells is hampered by the delicate nature of biologics resulting in decreased efficacy and/or enhanced toxicity due to degradation during the aerosolization process (Frokjaer and Otzen, 2005; U.S. FDA, 2014). From vaccine development it is known that large protein assemblies with repetitive arrays of antigens are usually the most potent for inducing immune responses (Muttil et al., 2010). In particular, the airways harbour many immunecompetent cells triggering immunological responses to drugs as it is well documented for intranasal vaccinations (Pabst, 2015). In particular, protein aggregates have a risk to induce immunogenicity representing a potential threat for the use of protein aerosols in the airways (Rombach-Riegraf et al., 2014). Luckily, suitable formulations can reduce the occurrence of protein aggregates, but established physiologic pre-clinical testing methods are lacking. Therefore, our aim was to provide a comprehensive screening platform with high-throughput potential for the development of formulations optimized for both protein stability during aerosolization and transepithelial permeation, the pre-requisite for drug delivery beyond the epithelial barrier. An important requirement of this study was to provide the manufactured proteins in a high quality without detectable aggregates. This was achieved by optimizing the manufacturing yield of IgG and Fab, respectively, and by adding an additional polishing step as previously reported (Röhm et al., 2016). Moreover, experimental drugs are often very expensive and in limited supply. Therefore, the screening platform was designed with stringent requirements on material-saving that included the use of the proteins at 30 μM (4 mg/mL for IgG), which is roughly 5-times lower than in a typical formulation for intravenous administration. The clinical relevant administered concentrations for airway delivery are quite diverse: while rather high concentrations are needed for intranasal insulin Nasulin™ (Leary et al., 2008), relatively low amounts of an Erythropoietin-Fc-fusion protein demonstrated clinical activity (Dumont et al., 2005). Relying on low concentrations for pre-clinical testing is not only advantageous in terms of cost-effectiveness, but also in terms of biodegradation testing, since proteins and other biotherapeutics are known to be more vulnerable in low concentrations, i.e. towards oxidation, deamidation or fragmentation affecting the heterogeneity and finally its safety and efficacy. For this study, well established excipients for biopharmaceuticals were selected according to the US and European Pharmacopeia (Rowe et al., 2009). The addition of surfactants, like PS20 is important to Fig. 3. Permeation of aerosolized proteins through the RPMI2650 cell layer to the abluminal transwell compartment. 30 μM Fab, IgG and FITC-dextran were dissolved in the three different formulations or vehicle (FITC-dextran only in F1) and nebulized with the vibrating mesh nebulizer placed on the ALICECLOUD chamber.

International Journal of Pharmaceutics 532 (2017) 537–546 543 reduce evaporation within the aerosol particle (Rasheed, 2008; Shire, 2015). Also, it has been reported that PS20 can form a protective film at the ALI that may shield proteins (Jamur and Oliver, 2010) and HBC has demonstrated to reduce shear stress at the ALI during agitation (Serno and Carpenter, 2009), which presumably is advantageous for protein aerosolization. Furthermore, trehalose and other polyols are able to protect proteins against thermal unfolding (Kaushik and Bhat, 1998; Liu et al., 2010) that was reported to occur in vibrating mesh nebulizers (Hertel et al., 2014b). An in vitro platform to assess the influence of different formulations on protein quality after aerosolization and transepithelial absorption is a prerequisite for the intranasal or inhalative delivery of proteins to the airway interstitium, where important effector cells for various diseases such as myofibroblasts for pulmonary fibrosis are residing (Fernandez and Eickelberg, 2012). Typically, this kind of permeation studies is performed under non-physiological, submerged cell culture conditions, i.e. the drug is pipetted (not aerosolized) into the cell culture medium, which completely covers the cells (Darquenne et al., 2016). This method is prone to provide biased results of drug transport, since it does not reflect the clinical conditions with respect to aerosolized drug delivery and ALI conditions of epithelial cells (Darquenne et al., 2016; Lenz et al., 2013). For instance, a burst-like permeation kinetics with a large initial transport rate followed by a rapid decline was found for aerosolized drug delivery to ALI cells, while this was not the case for in vitro testing with standard submerged cell culture systems, where the drug is pipetted (not aerosolized) into the cell culture medium. This was recently demonstrated for liposomal cyclosporine (Schmid et al., 2017). While ALI epithelial cell cultures have been available for quite some time, easy-to-use and yet sufficiently efficient and dose-controlled, aerosol-cell delivery systems were lacking. In 2009, the ALICE technology was introduced (Lenz et al., 2009) and employed successfully for toxicological studies to deliver aerosolized saline and nanoparticle suspensions to ALI cell cultures (Brandenberger et al., 2010a, 2010b; Endes et al., 2014; Lenz et al., 2009). Recently, the ALICE-CLOUD system, a refined version of the ALICE technology, was described and employed in a proof-of-concept study for inhalation drug screening focusing on small molecules (Lenz et al., 2014). This technology has the potential to become the state-of-the-art method for characterizing the performance of inhalation products and preclinical testing of innovative drug formulations (Lenz et al., 2014). In the present study, the commercial version of the ALICE-CLOUD technology (VITROCELL-CLOUD) is introduced, its performance is described and applied for the first time to proteins. For nebulization of the vehicle, the repeatability of the delivered dose, the insert-to-insert variability and the deposition factor agreed with the corresponding values reported by Lenz et al. for a 6- well prototype version of the ALICE-CLOUD system (Lenz et al., 2014). Similarly, no significant differences were observed for the formulations except for the deposition factor, which was higher (mean of all three formulations = 1.04) than the value reported for the vehicle (0.84). It is important to note that the enhanced deposition factor is associated with a 4-fold lower liquid/aerosol output rate of the nebulizer (0.25 and 1.0 mL/min for protein formulations and vehicle, respectively). Hence, it is likely that this phenomenon is due to differences in viscosity and/or surface tension of the nebulized substance, which are known to affect the liquid output rate of vibrating mesh nebulizers (Beck-Broichsitter et al., 2014). We conclude that the performance of the VITROCELLCLOUD system for protein formulations is as good as the previously described prototype of the ALICE-CLOUD system (Lenz et al., 2014). Surprisingly, the tendency on protein stability displayed in Fig. 1E and F was not indicative for abluminal recovery (Fig. 3) and the difference between vehicle and “best” formulations in these two experiments increased from roughly 30% observed for monomer recovery to 300% displayed in transport rate. A possible explanation for this might be the different experimental conditions, e.g. the exposure time to ALI: For monomer analysis, the formulated protein samples were nebulized into a 15 mL tube, where the wall-deposited droplets gathered quickly to a larger amount of fluid and were stored in a closed tube without gas exchange until analysis. By contrast, in the ALICE-CLOUD system less than 2.5 μL of the mist reached the transwell insert with an area of 0.336 cm2 forming an circa 7.5 μm thick liquid film on the luminal side of the cells. During the 90 min to 4 h incubation time in the incubator, an intensive interaction with air and in particular oxygen can be assumed. Although evaporation is mitigated due to the almost (water-)saturated conditions in the exposure chamber and the incubator, even small evaporation and re-condensation rates may not be beneficial for the structural integrity of the proteins. Since similar conditions are likely to occur on during inhalation therapy on the pulmonary epithelium, the conditions in the exposure system are likely to be closer to the in vivo conditions than in the highly artificial conditions during the nebulization experiments for monomer analysis. For future studies, these effects should be taken into account for monomer analysis by nebulizing the protein samples into the transwell inserts (e.g. with the ALICE-CLOUD) and including the prolonged incubation times for the permeability assay. This may improve the predictability of the stability screen for the permeation properties of protein formulations. In this study, the Fab was less stable than the IgG it was derived from. However, it cannot be concluded that Fabs are always less stable than fulllength IgGs, since manufacturing conditions or even concentration changes can speed up protein unfolding or aggregation process (Yano et al., 2009). In the present study, a clear negative correlation (power law) between molecular mass of the studied proteins and their transport rates was observed. This is consistent with results previously reported for peptides (Föger et al., 2008). Hence, the use of Fab or even smaller fragments instead of the full IgG promises better permeation through the airway tissue. However, also other aspects should be considered for transepithelial delivery of IgG to secondary organs such as the brain, which can be accomplished either through the lung (via blood circulation) or targeting through the nose (via olfactory bulb). Neonatal Fc receptors (FcRn) transport IgG via their Fc domain from the mucosal surface to the blood, which can be a very favourable uptake mechanism (Bitonti and Dumont, 2006). By contrast, FcRn also transport Fcbearing molecules from the brain to the blood (Cooper et al., 2013). A permeation of 11% through ex vivo porcine nasal mucosa after 2.5 h was reported for the clinical product Avastin® (Samson et al., 2012) containing the mAb bevacizumab formulated for parenteral use with 6% trehalose, 0.04% PS20 in phosphate buffer (Warne, 2011). In general, the percentage of transported drug is hardly comparable from one study to another as it differs dramatically when altering the experimental conditions. Therefore, we calculated from the published data (Samson et al., 2012) an absolute transport rate of roughly 65 fmol cm s· 2 , which is about 10-times higher than what we achieved here for IgG. This indicates that despite the high molecular mass of this mAb and although this formulation was not developed for nasal administration, a very efficient transport was evident, which might be related to FcRn. Recently, the presence of FcRn was confirmed in nasal epithelium (Heidl et al., 2016). Hence, Fc-bearing proteins as IgG and Fc-fusions may be advantageous for mucosal drug delivery when targeting the central compartment, and accordingly Fc-domain free antibody fragments and scaffolds may be more suitable for intranasal CNS delivery. It is well known that IgG (HIRMab 83-14) is transcytosed by its antigen, the insulin receptor (Pardridge et al., 1985). To exclude transcytosis of IgG in RPMI 2650, expression of human insulin receptor was tested by immunofluorescence, flow cytometry and RT-PCR (unpublished data). This analysis revealed that these cells hardly express any significant amount of insulin receptor. Therefore, we can exclude that transcytosis of IgG or Fab via the insulin receptor plays a relevant role in the RPMI 2650 model (Di Guglielmo et al., 1998). Currently, we perform a study that compares active and passive transport in the RPMI 2650 model and the kinetics observed in the present study clearly indicates passive transport mechanisms. So, it is conceivable that no other transcytosis mechanism is involved in this model. M. Röhm et al. International Journal of Pharmaceutics 532 (2017) 537–546 544 5. Conclusion With this study, we present an efficient screening platform for rapid and reliable evaluation of candidate formulations intended for high protein stability and efficient transepithelial transport of aerosolized drugs by combining and refining two automation-friendly technologies: a throughput-optimized aerosolization-surrogate assay for protein stability and the ALICE-CLOUD technology. This platform approach enables an efficient, high-throughput, and material-saving development of formulations for inhalative and intranasal delivery of aerosolized drugs. In addition, we conclude that − in spite of the dominating effect of the permeation assay for the proteins investigated here − a comprehensive formulation platform for protein aerosols should include both, evaluation of protein aggregation and effects on mucosal permeation to assess the full spectrum of a protein formulation.

16	2015	A miniaturized in vitro release method for investigating drug-release mechanisms	ABSTRACT We have evaluated a miniaturized in vitro method, based on the mDISS ProfilerTM technique that enables on-line monitoring of drug release from a 21ml sample with 10 ml of release medium. Four model drugs in eight clinically used formulations, including both solid and non-solid drug delivery systems, were investigated. The acquired data were compared with historical in vitro release data from the same formulations. Use of the Weibull function to describe the in vitro drug-release profiles allowed discrimination between the selected formulations with respect to the drug-release mechanisms. Comparison of the release data from the same formulation in different in vitro set-ups showed that the methodology used can affect the mechanism of in vitro release. We also evaluated the ability of the in vitro methods to predict in vivo activity by comparing simulated plasma concentration-time profiles acquired from the application of the biopharmaceutical software GI-Sim to the in vitro observations. In summary, the simulations based on the miniaturized-method release data predicted the plasma profiles as well as or more accurately than simulations based on the historical release data in 71% of the cases and this miniaturized in vitro method appears to be applicable for both solid and non-solid formulations 1. Introduction Successful drug development processes benefit from the combination of in vitro methods and in silico simulations that can predict the in vivo response (Lennernäs et al., 2014a). To enable accurate in vivo predictions from in vitro drug-release data, the drug must be released from the formulation by a similar mechanism both in vivo and in vitro (Larsen et al., 2013). There are standardized in vitro quality control release methods for oral formulations, as described for example in the US Pharmacopeia (USP). The USP experimental set-ups include the paddle, rotation and reciprocating cylinder apparatuses. However, these methods might not always be accurately predictive of the in vivo situation (Kostewicz et al., 2014b). Adjustments to the stirring rate, temperature and release medium (surfactant, ionic strength and pH) could alter the release rates to varying degrees, and information on this would be of value for accelerated and biorelevant in vitro release studies of modified-release formulations (Shen and Burgess, 2012). The use of a biorelevant medium that mimics the dynamic gastrointestinal fluid has also been shown to increase the predictability of in vitro methods (Klein, 2010; Kostewicz et al., 2014b). The mDISS profilerTM, a miniaturized dissolution apparatus that uses only small amounts of active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and releasemedium,was developed tomeasure the solubility of APIs in early drug development (Fagerberg et al., 2010; Tsinman et al., 2009). Importantly, this apparatus continuously monitors absorbance, using afiber-optic UV dip probelocated centrally in a glass vial (Avdeef and Tsinman, 2008). The mini-IDRTM disc, an additional application for the mDISS profilerTM, enables measurement of the intrinsic dissolution rate (IDR). Because the exposed area of the API is constant when measuring the IDR, it has been used to characterize dissolution profiles (Avdeef and Tsinman, 2008). Theoretical modeling is a useful tool in pharmaceutical development; it is used to investigate and characterize the release of the API from the drug delivery system (DDS) and to determine which factors influence the release rate (Siepmann and Siepmann, 2012). This type of knowledge is also useful during the innovation and development of novel DDSs where a specifically designed drug-release profile is needed to target specific pharmacodynamic and safety properties (Johannsson et al., 2011; Selen et al., 2014; Siepmann and Siepmann, 2012; Sjögren et al., 2014). The primary objective of this study was to improve understanding of the novel, miniaturized, in vitro,mDISSTM-based release method and to examine its potential for predicting in vivo data. The in vivo predictive abilities of release data from this novel method and of historical in vitro release data were compared using in silico simulations and the mechanisms of API release from selected DDSs were investigated using the Weibull function. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Chemicals and drug delivery systems Four APIs (metoprolol, diclofenac, naproxen and carbamazepine (Sigma–Aldrich, Sweden)), representing biopharmaceutics classification system (BCS) classes I and II (Wu and Benet, 2005), were investigated. Their physicochemical properties are listed in Table 1. The chosen drugs have typical physicochemical properties for drugs that are formulated in modified release dosage forms. The lipophilicity (log P) covers a three-fold range but the molecular weight covered a narrow range. Stock solutions were prepared by dissolving each API in ethanol (Solveco, Sweden). Mono- and dibasic potassium phosphate, used to prepare phosphate buffer saline (PBS), was acquired from Riedel de Haën, Germany. The in vitro release profiles of eight clinically used DDSs were investigated. Two of the DDSs were non-solid formulations (an oral suspension and a gel for dermal application), two were oral modified-release (MR) tablets, and four were oral immediaterelease (IR) tablets. The IR tablets contained metoprolol tartrate (SelokenTM 50 mg, Astra Zeneca, Sweden), naproxen (PronaxenTM 250 mg, Orion Pharma, Sweden), carbamazepine (TegretolTM 100 mg, Novartis, Sweden), and diclofenac (Voltaren TTM 25 mg, Novartis, Sweden). The MR tablets contained metoprolol succinate (Seloken ZOCTM 25 mg, Astra Zeneca, Sweden), and carbamazepine (Tegretol RetardTM 200 mg, Novartis, Sweden). The non-solid DDSs were a diclofenac dermal gel (VoltarenTM gel 11.6 mg/g), and an oral suspension of carbamazepine (TegretolTM oral suspension 20 mg/ml), both from Novartis, Sweden. 2.2. Sample reservoirs for the modifiedmDISSTM-based release method The dimensions of the mini-IDRTM disc were used as a starting point for developing a sample reservoir made of magnetic ferritic stainless steel, an Fe–Cr alloy (Olsson and Landolt, 2003). A small cylindrical cavity, 3 mm deep and 3 mm in diameter, with a sample volume of 21ml, was drilled centrally in the steel disc (Fig. 1). The opening was covered with a diffusion barrier (see description below) to retain the formulation sample in the reservoir. The diffusion barrier was held in place with a ring-shaped magnet placed centrally over the reservoir opening (Fig. 1). 2.3. Experimental design A mDiss profilerTM (pION, USA) was used for all of the miniaturized in vitro release experiments (Fig. 1). The UV dip probe in the mDiss profilerTM automatically performs spectral scans at intervals of 200–720 nm and calculates the drug concentration as the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of the second derivate spectrum. The second derivate spectrum enhances the peaks and reduces baseline shifting of the UV spectrum, which reduces the effects of background turbidity (Avdeef et al., 2009; Bijlani et al., 2007). The drug release studies were performed in triplicate; for each experiment, a 21ml sample was inserted into the sample reservoir and 10 ml of PBS buffer, pH 7.4, was added. A pH of 7.4 was chosen mainly because the method is intended for use with drugs delivered parenterally. However, it should be noted that the average ionization of the APIs at this pHwas no different from that at the intestinal pH of 6.8. If not otherwise stated, the stirring rate was set at 400 rpm. A nylon mesh filter (pore size 150mm), a polyvinylidene fluoride filter (pore size 0.45mm) and a cellulosebased dialysis membrane (approximate pore size 0.003mm) were used as drug diffusion barriers. These diffusion barrierswere soaked in de-ionized water for 10 min at room temperature before use. During the drug release experiments, the temperature was kept at 37 C using a water bath (Lauda, Germany). 2.4. In vitro release studies In the miniaturized method, in vitro studies investigated the effect of the choice of diffusion barrier on the time taken for metoprolol and diclofenac (dissolved in de-ionized water) to reach equilibrium, and the effect of the stirring rate (100–400 rpm) on the mass transport of metoprolol and diclofenac across the diffusion barrier. The polyvinylidene fluoride filter (pore size 0.45mm) provided appropriate mass transport values for these APIs and was use as the diffusion barrier in the stirring-rate hydrodynamic experiments. All the solid formulations except metoprolol MR were crushed and sieved (Retsch, Germany) to prepare the material for the  sample reservoir. The fraction of particles sized between 0.7 and 1.0 mm was collected and used for the in vitro release experiments. The matrix of the metoprolol MR tablet was dissolved in de-ionized water immediately prior to the experiment; within 5 min it disintegrated into small ethylcellulose-coated pellets (approximate size 0.5 mm) (Ragnarsson et al., 1987). Just before the start of the experiment, either the crushed particle fraction or the coated pellets were mixed with de-ionized water to create a slurry. 21ml of the resulting slurry was inserted into the sample reservoir and covered with the diffusion barrier, in this case the nylon mesh filter (pore size 150mm). The slurry was used to avoid air being trapped in the sample cavity and beneath the diffusion barrier, which could have reduced the mass transport of the API across the diffusion barrier. The non-solid DDSs (the gel and oral suspension) were inserted directly into the sample reservoir. All experiments were performed in triplicate. Historical in vitro and in vivo data on the eight DDSs were collected from published reports (Al Ameri et al., 2012; Elqidra et al., 2004; Friedman et al., 2000; Gohel et al., 2009; Kovacevic et al., 2008; Löbenberg et al., 2005; Nan et al., 2012; Nishihata, 1987; Parsaee et al., 2002; Reiner et al., 2001; Sandberg et al., 1988; Yuksel et al., 2000; Zhang et al., 2011; Zhou et al., 1998) and obtained quantitatively with PlotDigitizer (Free Software Foundation Inc., MA, USA). 2.5. Data analysis The nonlinear semi-log line of the software GraphPad Prism 6.04 (GraphPad Software, Inc., USA) was used to analyze the correlations between the pore size of the diffusion barrier and the time to equilibrium. Many models are available for theoretically modeling drugrelease mechanisms (Siepmann and Siepmann, 2008). However, the entire in vitro drug-release profile can be described by the Weibull function. In Eq. (1), the Weibull function has been slightly modified R%t ¼ R%max  ð1  expatb Þ (1) R%t and R%max are the percentage of drug released at time t and the maximum percentage released, respectively; a and b are constants describing the drug-release profile, and t is the time (Papadopoulou et al., 2006). The Weibull function has been reported to be useful in comparing release profiles for the delivery of drugs from various matrices (Dash et al., 2010). The combination of Monte Carlo simulations and experimental release data has shown that the values of b in the Weibull function can provide an indication of the release mechanisms involved in the drug release (Papadopoulou et al., 2006). In this study, Eq. (1) was fitted to the observed data using the average value of each time point for both the experimental and the historical data. The curve fitting was performed using the nonlinear least square regression in Phoenix 64 WinNonlin 6.3 software (Pharsight, USA). Estimated a and b values were then used to extrapolate the release profiles for complete drug release. The goodness of fit for each analysis was expressed as the absolute average fold error (AAFE), as described by Graham et al. (2012). Absoluteaveragefolderror ¼ 10SjlogPredicted Observedj N (2) AAFE describes the geometric mean ratio of the predicted and observed values and N describes the number of observations. An AAFE value of 1 indicates a perfect fit while a value of 2 indicates an average 2-fold difference from observed data points. 2.6. In silico simulations of in vivo response In silico simulations based on the experimental and historical in vitro data were obtained using the gastrointestinal (GI) absorption model GI-Sim (Sjögren et al., 2013). Briefly, the GI-Sim simulates human GI physiology with nine simulated GI compartments. The GI compartments are connected in series to represent the stomach (compartment 1), the small intestine (compartments 2–7) and the colon (compartments 8–9) (Yu and Amidon, 1999; Yu et al., 1996). Physiological parameters describing these GI compartments have been previously reported (Sjögren et al., 2013). The GI model is linked to a simulated systemic pharmacokinetic model, with up to three compartments, to enable simulations and predictions of the plasma concentration–time profiles. In GI-Sim drug particles and monomers flow from one GI compartment into the next. The particles either dissolve or grow, and the monomers partition into colloidal structures or are absorbed across the intestinal wall. The pH-dependent solubility of an ionizable compound in the lumen is calculated in GI-Sim according to the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation and the physiological pH of each GI compartment (Hasselbalch, 1916). The dissolution rate in GI-Sim is usually described by Fick’s law and the Nielsen stirring model (Nielsen, 1961); however, in this study, the in vitro experimental release profiles of the formulations were used for the appearance rate of free monomer in the GI compartments. The effective intestinal permeability for each API was used to describe the total serial transport process across the aqueous boundary layer adjacent to the intestinal wall and the small intestine membrane (Lennernäs et al., 1996; Sandberg et al., 1991; Sjögren et al., 2013; TubicGrozdanis et al., 2008). Absorption occurs in all intestinal compartments including the colon (there is no absorption in the stomach). The relevant physicochemical, biopharmaceutical, and pharmacokinetic properties of the investigated APIs and formulations are summarized in Table 2. The AAFE was used to analyze the goodness of fit between the predicted and observed plasma concentrations (Graham et al., 2012). 3. Results 3.1. Effect of diffusion barrier in the miniaturized release method There was a correlation between the pore size of the diffusion barrier and the time to reach equilibrium (time to reach plateau) in the sample reservoir and the release medium (Fig. 2). The equilibrium times for diclofenac across the nylon mesh filter, the polyvinylidenefluoridefilter and cellulose-baseddialysismembrane were 0.011 h, 4.3 h and 6.8 h, respectively. For metoprolol, the equilibrium times were 0.011 h, 18 h and 25 h, respectively. The correlation between equilibrium time, y (h), and pore size, x (mm) was described as y = 3.4 1.5  log x, R2 = 0.98, and y = 13 5.4 log x, R2 = 0.96, for diclofenac and metoprolol, respectively. The time to equilibrium for the nylon mesh filter (with a pore size of 150mm) was thus more than a hundred times shorter than that for the other two diffusion barriers: the polyvinylidenefluoridefilter (with a pore size of 0.45mm) and the cellulose-based dialysis membrane (with a pore size of 0.003mm). The influence of stirring rate on the API mass transport as a mean value of three observations, with the polyvinylidene fluoridefilter as diffusion barrier, is shown in Fig. 3. The mass transport of diclofenac across the diffusion barrier was increasing with higher stirring rate. However, there was no correlation between the stirring rate and the mass transport of metoprolol. After 1 h of stirring at 100, 200 or 400 rpm, the mass transport of metoprolol across the diffusion barrier was 76%, 86%, and 77%, respectively.  The indicated types of drug release varied according to the methodology used. Drug release through a highly disordered space was indicated for one data set (IR carbamazepine) (Elqidra et al., 2004). Drug release governed by diffusion in a fractal or disordered substrate was indicated only by data for IR formulations, including both the miniaturized-method experimental data for IR naproxen, IR diclofenac and IR metoprolol and historical data for IR carbamazepine and IR metoprolol (Kovacevic et al., 2008; Löbenberg et al., 2005). Diffusion through a normal Euclidian space was the most plausible drug release mechanism for one historical set of MR carbamazepine data (Friedman et al., 2000). Diffusion through a normal Euclidian space with the contribution of another release mechanism was suggested by historical data for MR metoprolol (Gohel et al., 2009) and diclofenac gel (Gohel et al., 2009; Parsaee et al., 2002), and by the miniaturized-method experimental results for MR carbamazepine, the oral carbamazepine suspension, and diclofenac gel. A first-order release rate was indicated by both historical data (Nan et al., 2012) and the experimental results for IR carbamazepine. A sigmoidal release curve, interpreted as indicating a complex release mechanism, was suggested by historical data sets for IR naproxen (Yuksel et al., 2000), IR diclofenac (two data sets) (Al Ameri et al., 2012; Nishihata, 1987) and MR metoprolol Sandberg et al. (1988), as well as by experimental data for MR metoprolol. The historical data for the oral carbamazepine suspension had too few reported data points (first data point at 80% released) to be analyzed in this manner. 3.3. In silico simulations of in vivo response The simulations of the plasma profiles obtained with GI-Sim were based on the miniaturized-method (mDISSTM) or historical in vitro release profiles (Al Ameri et al., 2012; Elqidra et al., 2004; Friedman et al., 2000; Gohel et al., 2009; Kovacevic et al., 2008; Löbenberg et al., 2005; Nan et al., 2012; Nishihata, 1987; Parsaee et al., 2002; Reiner et al., 2001; Sandberg et al., 1988; Yuksel et al., 2000; Zhang et al., 2011; Zhou et al., 1998). The plasma-time concentration profiles and the AUCs, maximum concentrations (Cmax) and times to Cmax (tmax) from the experimental and simulated data are shown in Fig. 5 and Table 5, respectively. The agreement between the predicted concentration-time plasma profiles and the observations was assessed using the AAFE with the respective values at the times of the observations. In addition, the predictive ability was evaluated from the agreement between the observed and simulated PK parameters (AUC, tmax and Cmax). In general, the simulations based on the data from the miniaturized in vitro method were in good agreement with the observed plasma profiles, with AAFE values in the range of 1.03–1.53. For five of the seven investigated DDSs (71%), the in vivo predictions (i.e., the accuracy of AUC, tmax and Cmax predictions) based on the miniaturized-method experimental data were equally or more accurate than the predictions based on historical in vitro release data. For the remaining two DDSs, MR metoprolol and IR carbamazepine, the in vivo prediction based on the miniaturized-method experimental data was less accurate than that based on two of the historical release data, with AAFE values of 1.53 and 1.31, respectively. 4. Discussion Eight DDSs were investigated using a novel, miniaturized, in vitro drug-release method and in silico modeling. The benefits of this method include the ability to collect data continuously, the use of only small amounts of sample and release medium, and the possibility of modifying the method by changing the diffusion barrier. The in vitro release profiles obtained using the miniaturized mDISSTM system were suitable for release mechanism analysis, and the predictability of in vivo behavior from the miniaturized-method data, evaluated using the biopharmaceutical in silico model GI-Sim (Sjögren et al., 2013) was generally more accurate than that from the historical data. 4.1. Evaluation of the diffusion barrier The diffusion barrier investigation showed that the nylon mesh filter with 150mm pores had only a minor impact on the equilibrium time (0.011 h), while the filters with smaller pores significantly increased the equilibrium time. There are several possible explanations for this observation. The pore size in the nylon mesh filter was presumably sufficiently large to facilitate the flow of fluids. Since the smaller pores reduced this fast fluid flow, the dominating mass transport mechanism across the dialysis membrane and the polyvinylidene filter may thus have been the slower molecular diffusion (Kostewicz et al., 2014b). The total available pore area determines the rate of mass transport when molecular diffusion is the main mechanism of transport. The two selected APIs, diclofenac and metoprolol, showed slightly different equilibrium times for the dialysis membrane which might be explained by different API affinity to the same dialysis membrane. Possibly, the positively charged metoprolol (pKa = 9.7) is attracted to the negatively charged cellulose membrane while the negatively charged diclofenac is not (pKa = 3.8). In all, care should be taken when choosing an appropriate diffusion barrier since the material may affect the equilibrium time. However, for DDSs such as emulsions, a dialysis membrane could prevent the formulation from spreading outside the sample reservoir, thereby reducing the pharmaceutical effect of the excipients on the UV measurements as well as better control of the available total surface area for release (Morais and Burgess, 2014). If the diffusion barrier influences the API mass transport, this effect needs to be evaluated and corrected for in future data analyses (Levy and Benita, 1990; Washington, 1989). A stirring rate of 400 rpm allowed sufficiently fast mass transport across the nylon mesh to minimize any influence on the drug-release profiles. However, further hydrodynamic investigation of the influence of the stirring rate on mass transport in the miniaturized release method is needed and is currently on-going. 4.2. Interpretation of the in vitro drug-release mechanism from drug delivery systems The use of the Weibull function, suggested by Papadopoulou et al. (2006) facilitates straightforward analysis of drug-release mechanisms and is applicable for a wide range of formulations and types of mechanism. The release of the drug in fractal or disordered matrices appears to be driven only by diffusion. Diffusion in irregular fractal spaces is slower than in a homogeneous Euclidian space (Kosmidis et al., 2003a). Diffusion in a homogeneous space  when another release mechanism also is involved indicates diffusion-driven release with additional input from case II transport. In case II transport, the relaxation of the tablet matrix polymers influences the movement of the APIs through the matrix (Kosmidis et al., 2003c). First-order drug release follows Fick’s law of diffusion (Papadopoulou et al., 2006). A sigmoidal release curve is indicative of a complex release mechanism, involving erosionbased release or the release of a relatively insoluble API (Kosmidis et al., 2003b; Papadopoulou et al., 2006). The drug-release mechanisms for seven of the IR formulation data sets (see Table 4) were, in accordance with theory and formulation strategy, based on diffusion through a fractal/ disordered matrix or diffusion according to Fick’s law (first-order release). In contrast, the data sets for IR naproxen and IR diclofenac suggested complex release mechanisms involving erosion or influence of the relative insolubility of the APIs (Kosmidis et al., 2003b). The release kinetics for the individually coated pellets of MR metoprolol indicated almost zero-order release over 24 h (Sandberg et al., 1988). To provide a drug release mechanism that follows zero-order kinetics, the DDS must be designed to overcome Fick’s law of diffusion, in which the diffusion is non-linear over time due to the changes in surface area and diffusion length (Chidambaram et al., 1998). Therefore, a more complex mechanism is required; this can be achieved, for example, by coating the pellets, as seen with the ethylcellulose coating used in MR metoprolol (Sandberg et al., 1988; Varelas et al., 1995). For the three MR metoprolol data sets, the indicated release mechanisms were either a complex mechanism or diffusion-controlled in combination with case II transport. Hence, the indicated release mechanisms for MR metoprolol are in line with the reported approximate zero-order release (Sandberg et al., 1988). For MR carbamazepine, the release mechanism indicated by the miniaturized-method data was different from that indicated by the historical data (see Table 4) (Friedman et al., 2000). API release was driven only by diffusion in the historical data set, while the miniaturized-method data set indicated the presence of diffusion with contribution from case II transport. When MR carbamazepine is used clinically, the patient is instructed not to crush the tablets. However, the prolonged in vitro release from the crushed tablet indicated that the individually coated pellets of the MR tablet remained intact (Kesarwani et al., 2007). The difference in the rate of drug release from diclofenac gel between data obtained using the miniaturized method and historical data was probably due to the large difference in pore size (more than a 50,000-fold difference) between the diffusion barriers. Nylon mesh (150mm pores) was used in the miniaturized method, whereas a cellulose acetate dialysis membrane with a molecular weight cut-off point of 1000 was used for collection of the historical data (Parsaee et al., 2002). In the novel, miniaturized, mDISSTM in vitro method, only a representative proportion of each DDS was investigated whereas, in the historical release methods, an intact formulation unit such as a tablet was examined. While the surface area of the diffusion barrier was constant during the miniaturized-method experiments, the surface area of the particles was not constant. The historical in vitro release experiments differed in the applied release equipment and set-ups, such as stirring rate, release medium (e.g., differing in pH and/or the addition of surfactant), as well as in the volume of release medium used (Al Ameri et al., 2012; Elqidra et al., 2004; Friedman et al., 2000; Gohel et al., 2009; Kovacevic et al., 2008; Löbenberg et al., 2005; Nan et al., 2012; Nishihata, 1987; Parsaee et al., 2002; Sandberg et al., 1988; Yuksel et al., 2000; Zhang et al., 2011). Therefore, the in vitro release profile and consequently the indicated release mechanism varied for the investigated DDS. As an example, the four in vitro data sets for IR carbamazepine differed with regard to the release method and the release medium used, and consequently the b values ranged between 0.27 and 1.0. The DDS for IR metoprolol was the exception; the same release mechanism was indicated in both the miniaturized-method and historical data sets. As expected, the release mechanism differed between the IR, MR and non-solid drug delivery systems. In conclusion, there was wide variation in the indicated release mechanisms between the data sets. The differences in method set-ups seemed to affect the drug release to a greater extent than the differences caused by using a representative part of the DDS or an intact unit. 4.3. Gastrointestinal (GI) absorption simulation In vitro data originating from both the miniaturized method and the historical investigations for four model drugs were inserted into the in silico model GI-Sim to predict the plasma concentration-time profiles in vivo. The in vitro release profiles as well as selected parameters listed in Tables 1 and 2 determined the predicted in vivo response. As shown in Fig. 4 the in vitro release method had an impact on the release profiles and consequently on the predicted plasma-time profiles. Based on the in vitro drugrelease profiles, GI drug absorption was predicted to occur mainly from the proximal small intestine or throughout the whole intestine including the colon. The potential for colonic absorption will be relevant for DDSs with prolonged drug-release profiles (>3 h), such as MR metoprolol, MR carbamazepine, and IR carbamazepine, as the specified mean transit time to reach the colon in GI-Sim is 3.5 h (Sjögren et al., 2013). Overall, the experimental data acquired with the novel, miniaturized, in vitro mDISSTM method gave more accurate predictions of the plasma concentration profiles than the historical in vitro data. The predictions based on the miniaturized method data were equally or more accurate than the predictions based on historical in vitro release data for 71% of the investigated DDSs. This was the case for both IR and MR formulations, indicating the overall accuracy of the modified miniaturized method. However, for IR carbamazepine and MR metoprolol one historical in vitro release data set for each formulation gave more accurate predictions. The in vivo profile for MR carbamazepine was very well described by the in vitro data, while the in vitro data for IR carbamazepine were somewhat less predictive. This appears contradictory, as it could be assumed that the in vitro drug-release profile for an IR formulation would be more likely to reflect the in vivo release profile. The inaccurate prediction for the IR formulation was also observed for two historical data sets (Elqidra et al., 2004; Nan et al., 2012). The in vivo predictions based on the in vitro data set from Kovacevic et al. were, however, accurate (Kovacevic et al., 2008). It is noteworthy that, in this investigation of the IR formulation, only 50% of the carbamazepine was released in 2 h (Kovacevic et al., 2008). The administered dose was predicted to be incompletely absorbed throughout the small and large intestine as a consequence of this slow release. For MR metoprolol, the in vitro release of the three data sets are quite similar (see Fig. 4), however, the predicted plasma-time profiles (see Fig. 5) are not. One in vitro release data set (Gohel et al., 2009) have a slightly higher drug release compared to the miniaturized method which lead to a higher absorption of metoprolol before the colon compartment of GI-Sim. This might be explained by a delay in the predicted tmax when based on release data from the miniaturized method. In this study, the combination of in vitro and in silico tools was a valuable asset for the evaluation of the in vivo predictive performance of the in vitro results. This advantageous combination has been shown previously, and there is an ongoing effort to further improve these synergistic methodologies (Kostewicz e 5. Conclusion The developed in vitro release method based on the miniaturized mDISSTM technique enables continuous sampling with small volumes of both DDS (21ml) and release medium (10 ml). In this experimental study, in vitro release data were collected from eight selected DDSs with four APIs. Collection of API release data was possible for both solid and non-solid formulations, as well as for charged and uncharged APIs. Both the miniaturized-method and the historical release data were used to estimate the release mechanisms and to predict the plasma concentration-time profiles in a biopharmaceutical GI absorption model (Al Ameri et al., 2012; Elqidra et al., 2004; Friedman et al., 2000; Gohel et al., 2009; Kovacevic et al., 2008; Löbenberg et al., 2005; Nan et al., 2012; Nishihata, 1987; Parsaee et al., 2002; Reiner et al., 2001; Sandberg et al., 1988; Sjögren et al., 2013; Yuksel et al., 2000; Zhang et al., 2011; Zhou et al., 1998). The indicated release mechanisms for the APIs varied according to the source of the data. This discrepancy most likely originated from differences in the methods used, such as the stirring rate, the release medium used, and the in vitro apparatus used. For five of the seven evaluable drug formulations, predictions of the in vivo plasma concentration-time profiles obtained using the novel, miniaturized, mDISSTM in vitro data were at least as accurate as those obtained from the historical in vitro data. These promising results could reduce the amounts of the formulations and release media required in the collection of in vitro data, while still generating accurate in vivo predictions.	E. Ahnfelt, E.

17	2015	Microvesicle- and exosome-mediated drug delivery enhances the cytotoxicity of Paclitaxel in autologous prostate cancer cells	ABSTRACT Background: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are naturally occurring membrane particles that mediate intercellular communication by delivering molecular information between cells. In this study, we investigated the effectiveness of two different populations of EVs (microvesicle- and exosome-enriched) as carriers of Paclitaxel to autologous prostate cancer cells. Methods: EVs were isolated from LNCaP- and PC-3 prostate cancer cell cultures using differential centrifugation and characterized by electron microscopy, nanoparticle tracking analysis, and Western blot. The uptake of microvesicles and exosomes by the autologous prostate cancer cells was assessed by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. The EVs were loaded with Paclitaxel and the effectiveness of EV-mediated drug delivery was assessed with viability assays. The distribution of EVs and EV-delivered Paclitaxel in cells was inspected by confocal microscopy. Results: Our main finding was that the loading of Paclitaxel to autologous prostate cancer cell-derived EVs increased its cytotoxic effect. This capacity was independent of the EV population and the cell line tested. Although the EVs without the drug increased cancer cell viability, the net effect of enhanced cytotoxicity remained. Both EV populations delivered Paclitaxel to the recipient cells through endocytosis, leading to the release of the drug from within the cells. The removal of EV surface proteins did not affect exosomes, while the drug delivery mediated by microvesicles was partially inhibited. Conclusions: Cancer cell-derived EVs can be used as effective carriers of Paclitaxel to their parental cells, bringing the drug into the cells through an endocytic pathway and increasing its cytotoxicity. However, due to the increased cell viability, the use of cancer cell-derived EVs must be further investigated before any clinical applications can be designed. 1. Introduction Extracellular vesicles (EVs) such as exosomes (EXOs) and microvesicles (MVs) are lipid membrane-bound vesicles that cells secrete into the extracellular environment. EVs contain a variety of molecules from their cell of origin including different species of RNA and proteins, which retain their bioactive properties when delivered to other cells [1]. EV cargo and their overall composition vary according to the parent cell type, its state of activation and/or stress conditions [2]. Additionally, EVs may target specific cells or tissues for cargo delivery [3]. For these reasons, EVs are thought to play a physiologically significant role in the intercellular communication between cells in healthy and pathological conditions. Cancer cells secrete EVs in order to interact with their environment in ways which promote tumor growth. The effects of cancer cell-derived EVs are diverse and they may also depend on their target cells. EVs have, for example, been reported to promote the formation of a suitable cancerous microenvironment [2] or to reduce the anticancer immune response [4]. Cancer cells are also an important target of their own EVs, which may enhance their proliferation [5], or transfer some properties of their own phenotype via vesicles, such as drug resistance by RNA- and protein delivery [6]. The current research suggests that EVs are naturally occurring cargo delivery agents which could also be used as vehicles for drug delivery. What would make them especially suitable for this task is the combination of their innate biocompatibility, their capacity to deliver different types of cargo, and their ability to target specific cells. EVs have already been tried for the delivery of different therapeutic agents in in vitro and in vivo experiments, as reviewed in [7]. Notably, EVs have been shown to be able to cross the blood–brain barrier in mice and to deliver siRNA against the protein BACE1 for treatment of Alzheimer's disease to uptake EVs loaded with different chemotherapeutics, resulting in the killing of cancer cells while also reducing the drugs' unfavorable side effects [12]. In this study, we evaluated the use of EVs from two prostate cancer (PCa) cell lines, PC-3 and LNCaP in cell targeting and in the in vitro delivery of Paclitaxel (PtX), a widely used antimitotic cancer therapeutic. The advantage of using autologous cancer cell-derived EVs is that they are uptaken by cancer cells themselves, as well as by the other cells in the tumor microenvironment. However, since cancer cell-derived EVs have been suggested to promote cancer cell survival and proliferation [5], we firstly assessed whether these EVs were capable of promoting proliferation and secondly, whether this effect could still be overcome by a sufficient concentration of PtX. We also studied the dependency of the EV uptake on the vesicle subtype, along with the dosage and the effect of EV surface proteins on the cytotoxic effect of PtX-loaded EVs (PtX-EVs), as well as on the overall uptake. Our results showed that EVs were continuously uptaken by the PCa cells. The EV-borne PtX was delivered into the cells via an endocytic pathway and released into the cell cytosol causing cell death. Most significantly, the EVmediated delivery enhanced the cytotoxic effect of the drug. These results suggest that autologous EVs may have potential for effective delivery of chemotherapeutics to cancer cells. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Cell culture LNCaP and PC-3 PCa cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Both cell types were grown in T-175 flasks to 80% confluence at 37 °C and 5% of CO2. LNCaP cells were grown in Roswell Park Memorial Institute 1640 medium (RPMI), and PC-3 cells in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM/F12), both supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% of penicillin/streptomycin (100 units/mL penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin). All reagents were purchased from Gibco, Life Technologies. The fetal bovine serum was vesicle-depleted by an overnight ultracentrifugation at 110,000 ×g, followed by filtration through a 0.22 μm Steritop filter (Millipore). 2.2. EV isolation using differential centrifugation EVs were isolated from conditioned medium using differential centrifugation as described by Lazaro-Ibañez et al. [13] and reviewed by others [14,15]. In brief, the conditioned medium was centrifuged at 2500 ×g for 25 min to remove cell debris. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 20,000 ×g for 60 min to obtain the MVs and the final supernatant was ultracentrifuged at 110,000 ×g for 1 h to obtain the EXOs. To more precisely define the EV populations isolated in this study, the centrifugal force used for the isolation of each fraction is stated in the text resulting in 20K MV fraction and 110K EXO fraction. The 20K MV and 110K EXO pellets were resuspended in 100 μL of Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline (DPBS) (Gibco, Life Technologies). To wash and concentrate the collected EV samples, vesicles were suspended in 1 mL DPBS and pelleted by ultracentrifugation at 170 000 ×g, +4 °C for 3 h using Optima MAX-XP ultracentrifuge with rotor TLA-55 (Beckman Coulter). The resuspended pellets, containing a small volume of the supernatant (30–50 μL), were then stored at −80 °C. 2.3. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) The 150 mesh formvar copper grids (EMS™) were exposed to the Glow Discharge technique (2 min, 2.4 MA). Then, 4 μL of EV samples were individually added onto the grids and incubated for 2 min at 4 °C. Subsequently, the grids were washed with distilled water, negatively stained with 2% aqueous uranyl acetate (System Biosciences, Mountain View) for 2 min and dried out in darkness for 20 min. The samples were analyzed by TEM (FEI Tecnai 12) at 80 kV and Gatan Orius SC 1000B CCD-camera in the EM-unit, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland. For Cryo-EM imaging of EV samples, carbon grids were first purified with the Gatan Solarus (model 950) plasma cleaning system. Three μL of EV samples were then added onto the grids and frozen with Vitrobot (FEI) in liquid nitrogen. The samples were analyzed by JEOL JEM-3200FSC field emission Cryo-TEM in the Nanomicroscopy center, Aalto University, Espoo, Finland. 2.4. Western blot analysis (WB) The total protein content of cells and EVs was analyzed in triplicates by the MicroBCA protein assay kit (Thermo scientific) according to manufacturer's recommendations. The samples were diluted in DPBS in ratios of 1:100–1:1000 and incubated at 95 °C for 15 min. Varioskan Flash multireader (v.2.4.3) (Thermo Scientific) with a 562 nm absorbance filter was used to analyze the samples. To remove EV surface proteins, the samples were incubated with 0.25% (w/v) trypsin solution (Invitrogen, Life Technologies) at +37 °C for 30 min. The whole cell lysates and EVs were suspended into RIPA buffer (Thermo Scientific) supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma-Aldrich) according to the manufacturer's recommendations and prepared in 2× Laemmli buffer (Bio-Rad) under non-reducing conditions. Equal amounts of protein from EVs and cells were loaded onto 10–12% MiniPROTEAN TGX™ gels (Bio-Rad). After electrophoresis (100 V, 30 mA), the proteins were transferred onto Protran nitrocellulose membrane (Whatman International Ltd). The membranes were blocked with 5% (w/v) skim milk powder in Tris-buffered saline Tween 20 (TBS-T) and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature (RT) in 5% milk in TBS-T with the following primary antibodies: mouse monoclonal antihuman CD9 (clone ALB 6) (1:200), anti-CD81 (clone 5A6) (1:200), anti-GAPDH (7B) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (1:500), anti α-Tubulin (clone 6A204) (1:2000), anti-CD63 (clone H5C6) (1:200) (BD Pharmingen™), and anti-TSG101 (BD Transduction Laboratories) (1:250). After being washed, the membrane was incubated for 45 min in 2.5% milk in TBS-T at RT with goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Following another wash, the membranes were incubated for 3 min at RT with Luminata TM Crescendo Western HRP Substrate (Millipore) and visualized with Amersham Hyperfilm™ ECL (GE Healthcare Limited). 2.5. Nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) Purified EV samples were analyzed by NTA using Nanosight model LM14 (Nanosight) equipped with blue (404 nm, 70 mW) laser and SCMOS camera. The samples were diluted in DPBS and three 90 s videos were recorded using camera level 13–14. The data was analyzed using NTA software 2.3 with the detection threshold optimized for each sample and screen gain at 10 to track as many particles as possible with minimal background. 2.6. Zeta potential (ZP) To assess the effect of trypsin treatment on the surface charge of the EVs, zeta potential was measured by using Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern Instruments Ltd). Half of the samples were treated with trypsin as described above, while the rest served as a control for the treatment. Particle concentrations from the column-purified samples were measured Elution was monitored by UV-absorbance at 229 nm. The retention time of PtX was 1.7 min. To measure the PtX concentration of the PtXEVs samples, pellets of PtX-EVs were prepared as described above (Section 2.7). The pellets were dissolved in acetonitrile, centrifuged at 10,000 ×g, and 10 μL of the supernatant was injected into the UPLC instrument. Prior to the determination of the PtX concentration from the EV pellet, the acetonitrile extraction method was confirmed by spiking non-loaded EV pellets with 1.8 μM PtX. To study the release of PtX from the PtX-EVs into their surrounding solution, a pellet of PtX-EVs was suspended in DPBS and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. After that, half of the sample was measured and the other half continued the incubation for another 24 h. The 24/48 h samples were centrifuged at 170,000 ×g for 2 h and the concentration of the leaked PtX was measured from each of the resulting supernatants. 2.9. Viability assays Five thousand trypsin-detached cells were seeded in a black 96-well plate (CulturPlate, PerkinElmer), leaving five wells empty for background measurements and the outermost wells filled with sterile water. Cells were grown for two days before replacing the growth medium with fresh medium containing either PtX alone, EVs or PtX-EVs. For PtX cell cytotoxicity assays without EVs, different concentrations of PtX were prepared from the stock 1000 × PtX solution into DMSOisobutanol, which was then added to the culture medium at a ratio of 1:1000. Cell viability was measured after 24, 48, and 72 h by using the AlamarBlue viability assay according to manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies). Fluorescence intensity was measured using VarioSkan Flash multireader with 560 nm excitation and 590 nm emission filter settings. The viability values were then calculated from the fluorescence intensity values as a percentage of the control cells after removing the mean background values. 2.10. Fluorescent labeling of EVs EVs were double-labeled with DiD lipophilic dye (Biotium) and OregonGreen-labeled PtX (OG-PtX), (Invitrogen) to study the cellular distribution of PtX-EVs. First, the EVs were incubated for 1 h at RT with 5 μL of DiD per mL of EV suspension in DPBS. The unbound dye was removed by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and the particle concentration was determined by NTA before labeling with OG-PtX. Next, 5 × 109 vesicles were incubated with 1 μL of OG-PtX (5 μM final concentration) in 1 mL of DPBS for 1 h at RT. For the colocalization studies of EVs and endosomes/lysosomes, the EVs were labeled with DiO lipophilic dye (Biotium) and washed by ultracentrifugation as described previously in Section 2.7 and the cells were labeled with 70 nM LysoTracker® Red (Invitrogen) for 2 h and washed prior to imaging. For the uptake experiments, EVs were labeled with 2 μg/mL of DilC18(5)-DS red dye (Life Technologies) for 20 min at 37 °C protected from light. Then, the EVs were pelleted by ultracentrifugation at 170,000 ×g for 2 h and the pellet was washed as previously described in Section 2.8 before suspending it into 1 mL of cell culture medium. 2.11. Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) The EVs were purified by size exclusion chromatography as described by Böing et al. [16] to remove unbound dyes and protein fragments after trypsin-treatment for ZP measurements. The presence of EVs in the eluted fractions was confirmed with NTA, with the highest concentrations of vesicles usually found in fractions 8 and 9. 2.12. Uptake experiments 5 × 105 PC-3 cells and 3 × 105 LNCaP cells were seeded in 6-well plates (Corning Costar, Sigma-Aldrich) at 70% confluence. The cells were then washed with DPBS and incubated with cell culture medium containing 108 –109 particles/mL of the 20K MVs- or the 110K EXOs. Following this, the cells were incubated with their autologous EVs for 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, 32, and 48 h. Cells without EVs were used as negative controls. At each time point, the supernatant was removed and the wells were washed two times with DPBS. Cells were detached by trypsin treatment and after several washes fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in DPBS at 37 °C for 15 min. 10,000 events were analyzed within 6 h by flow cytometry (Gallios, Beckman Coulter) using FL6 channel (638 nm laser). To analyze the internalized and surface-associated EVs, the geometrical mean fluorescence intensity of the cells was determined. Flow-Check™ Pro Fluorospheres (Beckman Coulter) were measured in order to verify fluidics and laser alignment. Data was processed by using FlowJo software 10.0. 2.13. Live cell microscopy Microscopy studies were performed using a TCS SP5II HCS A (Leica) confocal microscope and a 3I Marianas (3I intelligent Imaging Innovations) wide field microscope with respective 63× water immersion objectives. The PC-3 and LNCaP cells (50,000–100,000 cells) were seeded on a 3 cm culture dish with a poly-D-lysine coated glass coverslip (Mattek) two days prior to the imaging. On the imaging day, the cells were given the labeled EVs, free PtX, PtX-EVs or a combination. The cells, incubated with labeled PtX-EVs, were followed for the first 6 h, recording z-stacks covering the cells' thickness, and then additional images were taken after 24 and 48 h of incubation. Finally, the images were processed with Fiji ImageJ 1.49c. 2.14. Statistical analysis Statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS 22.0 and SigmaPlot 11.0. The significance of cell viability measurements were tested against the control groups using one-way ANOVA with Tamhane's T2 post hoc t-test with 95% and 99% confidence intervals. The effect of trypsinization on cell viability and the ZP of EVs were examined using independent sample and paired sample t-tests respectively. The protein amount per particle for the 20 MVs and the 110K EXOs from both cell lines was analyzed using the Mann–Whitney Rank Sum Test. 3. Results 3.1. PCa EV subpopulations differ in terms of protein content and zeta potential 20K MV- and 110K EXO-enriched EV subpopulations were isolated from the conditioned media by using a differential ultracentrifugation with a yield of 1011–1012 particles/mL (approximately 250 mL of media in one isolation round). The isolated EV populations were characterized by TEM, NTA, total protein content, and WB analyses (Fig. 1). Based on these results and because at the moment there is no clear consensus in the EV field to distinguish the MV and the EXO subpopulations from each other [14,15], we renamed the subtypes with the speed used for their isolation. The 110K EXOs were often b200 nm in diameter and they showed an artificial cup-shaped morphology when analyzed by TEM (Fig. 1A), while the 20K MVs were a heterogeneous population mostly N200 nm in diameter (Fig. 1B). On the other hand, the size of both populations overlapped when measured by NTA, which was a result of the heterogeneity of the EV preparations by differential centrifugation (Fig. 1C–D). When the ratio of protein per particle was analyzed from both PCa cell lines, 110K EXOs had significantly more protein than 20K MVs (p-value ≤ 0.003) (Fig. 1E), which were on average 6.88 × 10−9 protein/particle for LNCaP 20K MVs and 2.7 × 10−8 protein/particle for LNCaP 110K EXOs; and 2.98 × 10−8 protein/particle for PC-3 20K MVs and 7.02 × 10−8 protein/particle for PC-3 110K EXOs. Assessing the common EV protein markers CD9, CD81, CD63, and TSG101 by WB showed that they were all enriched in the EVs compared with the cells, regardless of the EV subpopulation. Also, α-tubulin and GAPDH were found to be present in the PCa EVs (Fig. 1F). Trypsin treatment of EVs did not damage the EV structure (Fig. 2A–B), but almost completely removed the surface proteins of the 20K MVs and 110K EXOs, as shown for the transmembrane proteins CD9 and CD63 (Fig. 2C). In addition, the ZP of EVs was mildly but not statistically significantly affected by trypsin treatment. EVs from both cell lines had similar ZP values (Fig. 2D). The mean ZP was approximately −11.90 mV for the 110K EXOs and −11.22 mV for the 20K MVs. Cleavage of the surface proteins affected the subpopulations differently: the ZP of most of the 110K EXO samples became on average 8% less negative and the ZP of most the 20K MVs became on average 21% more negative. The average ZP-values after trypsin treatment in all the samples changed to −10.51 mV for the 110K EXOs (p = 0.221) and −13.35 mV for the 20K MVs (p = 0.043). 3.2. PCa cells efficiently uptake autologous EVs To study their cellular uptake and the intracellular trafficking of EVs, LNCaP and PC-3 cells were incubated with their own DilC18(5)-DSlabeled vesicles for different time periods (1–24 h). EVs from both PCa cell lines were actively and continuously bound and internalized (Fig. 3A) when analyzed by flow cytometry. The internalization increased as a function of time with no differences in the efficiency of LNCaP and PC-3 uptake. At the early time points (1–3 h), there was a lag in the fluorescence intensity which was followed by an increase in the uptake after 6 h continuing further to 24 h (Fig. 3A) and 48 h (Fig. 3B), the end of the follow-up period. When the uptake of these EVs was compared with the trypsin-treated vesicles (Fig. 3B), no significant differences were observed between the trypsin-treated and the non-treated 110K EXOs, indicating that the uptake was not determined by the surface proteins. However, the uptake of the 20K MVs was notably decreased as a result of the treatment, suggesting that surface proteins were at least partially involved in the uptake of the 20K MVs. 3.3. PCa-derived EVs increase cell viability To study the capacity of PCa-derived EVs to influence cancer cell viability, PC-3 and LNCaP cells were incubated with different EV subtypes and the change in their viability was measured against an EV-free control group after 24 and 48 h(Fig. 4). Both the 20K MVs and the 110K EXOs increased the cell viability of their respective cell lines. In PC-3 cells, there was a clear difference between the two populations of EVs with the 110K EXOs(Fig. 4D) having a stronger viability increasing effect than the 20K MVs(Fig. 4C), which was most apparent after 48 h of incubation. In LNCaP cells, the 110K EXOs (Fig. 4B) seemed to have a slightly stronger effect than the 20K MVs (Fig. 4A) at both time points. In general, the effect of EVs was found to be dose-dependent, although in the case of PC-3 20K MVs, a similar effect was observed with all doses examined. Fig. 2. Effect of trypsin treatment in EVs. A–B) Visualization of trypsinized (A) vs. non-trypsinized (B) LNCaP-derived 20K MVs by Cryo-EM. Spherical vesicles with a lipid bilayer can be observed, but no broken vesicles. Scale bars: 100 nm. C) A representative figure of the Western blot of trypsinized and non-trypsinized 20K microvesicles (MVs) and 110K exosomes (EXOs). The EV markers CD9 and CD63 were assessed by Western blotting before and after trypsin treatment. 50 μg of protein was loaded per lane. This panel is representative of three independent protein preparations showing the same trend. Very low amounts of CD9 and CD63 proteins remained after trypsin treatment.

EV uptake was measured by determining the geometric mean fluorescence intensity of the cells. The mean ± SE of three independent experiments are shown. B) Comparison of the u 3.4. Cytotoxicity of PtX can be enhanced by EV-mediated delivery The cytotoxic effect of the PtX-EVs on autologous PCa cells was compared to the free drug by viability assays. Cell viability curves were established as a function of PtX-EV dose for both PC-3 and LNCaP cells (Fig. 5 and S2). 5 μM PtX served as a point of comparison for the cell viability assays of PtX-EVs, since higher drug concentrations were found to precipitate in the solution. First, PtX-EVs were prepared with a high concentration of EVs (5 × 109 particles/mL) in the 5 μM PtX loading solution (ratio of 1 nmol of PtX/109 EVs). After removal of the unbound drug, a dilution series was utilized with both of the cell lines to establish the dose-dependency of the PtX-EVs. According to the UPLC measurements of the EV-bound PtX, approximately 9.2% (SD ± 4.5%) of the drug was bound to the EVs on average as a result of the loading regardless of the EV-concentration (Table 1). The final PtX concentration in the PtX-EV preparations was 0.46 μM on average (SD ± 0.22 μM). Confocal microscopy images of DiD-labeled EVs and OG-labeled PtX showed colocalization of the drug with the EVs, while no detectable staining of the cells' microtubules by free OG-PtX was observed after one hour of incubation (Fig. S1). Additionally, UPLC measurements of the amount of PtX released from the PtX-EVs incubated in 37 °C for 24 and 48 h after loading revealed that no detectable amounts of PtX were leaking into their surrounding medium during this time (n20K MVs = 3, n20K EXOs = 3). The dose-dependent cytotoxic effect of free PtX was clearer on PC-3 cells than LNCaP cells, which responded similarly to all different concentrations of the drug (Figs. 5A and S2.A). The maximum decrease in PC-3 cell viability was about 40% after 24 h (max mean difference 41.3, SE ± 3.16, p = 3.6 × 10−10) and 60% after 48 h (max mean difference 63.5, SE ± 1.54, p b 10−15) from concentrations of 50 nM and above, while the cytotoxic effect of PtX at 10 nM and below was significantly smaller (16% at 24 h and 27% decrease 48 h, p = 4.63 × 10−4 and 1.45 × 10−7 , respectively). In LNCaP cells, viability consistently decreased to approximately 80% and 60% after 24 and 48 h respectively, regardless of the dose (Fig. S2.A). Incubating the cells directly with free PtX and unloaded EVs resulted in the reduction of the cytotoxic effect at the 24 hour timepoint compared to the cytotoxicity of PtX-EVs, but the effect was similar to the EV-free 5 μM PtX control at 48 h (Fig. S2.B). For both cell lines and EV subtypes, a saturation point was reached approximately at 109 PtX-EVs/mL (Figs. 5B–C and S2.C–D). At this and higher concentrations, maximal cytotoxic effect of PtX-EVs was observed, while at lower concentrations PtX-EVs had a lesser or even a viability enhancing effect. At 48 h, the maximal cytotoxic effect of PtX-EVs was lower than with the 5 μM free PtX except for the PC-3 PtX-20K MVs, which exceeded the cytotoxicity of the free PtX. Finally, the viability enhancing effect of low concentrations of the PtX-110K EXOs was similar to what was observed with the unloaded EVs at corresponding concentrations. Next, PtX-EVs were prepared with an EV concentration below the apparent saturation point to examine whether a non-saturating number of EVs loaded with more drug per vesicle would have had a stronger cytotoxic effect. 108 EVs/mL were loaded in 5 μM PtX, corresponding to a drug per vesicle ratio 50 times higher than used in the previous experiment. The cytotoxic effect of these PtX-EVs was stronger than that of those prepared with less PtX per vesicle, and it also exceeded the effect of the PtX-control at 48 h with both EV subpopulations (Fig. 5C). Increasing the amount of free PtX beyond 5 μM in the control groups did not increase its cytotoxic effect, so the effect of 5 μM PtX was considered as the maximal cytotoxic effect of free PtX. It was also confirmed that the enhanced cytotoxicity persisted at 72 h of incubation (Fig. 5D). Further, cytotoxicity also persisted regardless of changing the medium after 48 h. Differences at 48 and 72 h between the cells treated with 5 μM free PtX and the highest concentrations of 110K EXOs/20K MVs were found to be significant with a confidence interval of 99%. To study the significance of the EV surface proteins in the cytotoxicity of PtX-EVs, the same PtX-EVs were treated with trypsin and compared against non-treated EVs. The trypsin-treated PtX-110K EXOs had an almost identical cytotoxic effect compared to the non-treated PtX-EVs (Fig. 5E). A statistically significant decrease in the cytotoxicity of the trypsin-treated PtX-EVs was apparent only at the lowest concentrations of the PC-3 PtX-20K MVs at 24 and 48 h (Fig. 5F) and at the lowest concentration of the PtX-110K EXOs at 48 h (Fig. 5E). (p-values 1.03 × 10−8 and 1.24 × 10−8 for 107 PtX-20K MVs/mL and 0.0079 and 0.0024 for 106 PtX-20K MVs/mL at 24 and 48 h and 0.049 for 106 PtX-110K EXOs/mL at 48 h). 3.5. EVs deliver PtX through an endocytic pathway releasing the drug within the cells To investigate the internalization route of the EVs, we investigated their localization by staining the cells with LysoTracker® Red, a fluorescent marker for labeling acidic organelles such as endosomes and lysosomes (Fig. 6). First, the DiO-labeled EVs were incubated with PC-3 (Fig. 6A) and LNCaP (Fig. 6B) cells for 24 h and the cells were examined by fluorescence microscopy after the addition of LysoTracker® Red. An intracellular fluorescent pattern of green labeled EVs was found to colocalize with the cell endosomal or lysosomal compartments (red), while EVs that had not yet been internalized were found on the plasma membrane. These data demonstrate that the internalized EVs and therefore also the PtX carried by them were delivered into the cells via the endocytic pathway. Next, LNCaP and PC-3 cells were treated with OG-PtX-loaded DiDEVs and DiD-EVs with free OG-PtX. When PCa cells were given free PtX from the medium, it spread into the cells binding to the microtubules (Fig. 7C–D). PtX from the medium caused the cells to eventually lose their elongated, branched shape and become spherical before they started dissociating and dying (Fig. 7D). When PtX was delivered into the cells by EVs, PtX was transported into the cells via the endocytic pathway regardless of the EV-subtype used as the vehicle, and then liberated within the cytosol (Fig. 7A–B). In the endosomal network the EV-delivered PtX appeared to eventually separate from the EVlabel. After dissociating from the EVs, the PtX spread into the cells. The liberated PtX then stained the microtubules similarly to the staining by the free PtX from the culture medium, albeit more weakly (Fig. 7C–D). Cells were also incubated with free PtX and EVs that were not loaded with the drug. Even though the EVs were not loaded with PtX when they were given to the cells, the OG-PtX was also found in the endosomes, which suggested that the PtX could partially bind to the EVs in the medium. At 24 h, the cells that were still alive with PtXEVs had taken up notable amounts of EVs and only small or undetectable amounts of PtX-label, which suggested that they had not received sufficient amounts of PtX via EVs to kill them (Fig. 7B). 4. Discussion The main finding of the present study is that EVs can enhance the cytotoxic effect of PtX when autologous EVs were used to deliver the drug to PCa cells in vitro. Although PtX has previously been shown to be deliverable by EVs [12,17], including autologous cancer cell derived EVs [18], so far, there have not been previous comparisons of the two main populations of EVs as drug carriers with the exception of the study by Zhuang et al. [9], showing that 10,000 ×g-isolated MVs were less effectively accumulated in the mouse brain than EXOs. Given the heterogeneity of the vesicle populations isolated by the current gold standard differential centrifugation, it is not yet clear which vesicle type will be the best to further optimize for carrying certain amounts of therapeutic cargo. In our study, although the cytotoxicity enhancing effect of PtX by EVs was moderate, it was statistically significant. Both EV populations, the 20K MVs and the 110K EXOs, were capable of enhancing the cytotoxic effect of the drug at high PtX concentrations. However, when a high concentration of EVs was loaded with a relatively low amount of PtX per vesicle, the 20K MVs seemed to be more effective drug carriers than the 110K EXOs. Overall, our study suggests that regardless of their differences, both types of EVs could be useful as biomimetic targeted drug carriers in cancer therapy. To address the role of EV surface proteins in drug delivery, we assessed the effect of trypsinization on the cellular uptake of EVs and on the cytotoxicity of PtX-EVs. We found that although there were differences, for instance, in the protein content and zeta potential of 20K MVs and 110K EXOs, their cellular uptake and efficiencies as drug carriers were quite similar. The trypsin treatment disrupted surface proteins like CD9 and CD63 present in LNCaP- and PC-3 cell-derived vesicles, but did not significantly affect the uptake of 110K EXOs by their parental cells (Fig. 3B), and their overall efficiency as drug carriers remained quite similar (Fig. 5E). We did observe, however, that the 20K MVs were more sensitive to trypsin treatment in terms of PtX-20K MV cytotoxicity (Fig. 5F), which might be explained by their reduced uptake after the treatment (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that EV-associated protein markers may not be the key players in the vesicle internalization as has been previously reported [19]. The effect of trypsin treatment on the ZP of EVs was inconclusive, although there was an apparent trend, reducing the negative charge of the 110K EXOs and increasing the ZP of the 20K MVs. The overall surface charge of EVs is likely to be dominated by the charged lipids of the membrane, but the surface proteins might also provide a shielding effect masking the lipids partially. Thus, their removal might have an unpredictable effect. Besides membrane proteins, the relevance of other EV membrane components for the vesicle uptake, such as the lipid signatures [19] has been suggested, while some pathways such as micropinocytosis might not require any specific interaction at all between the cell and EVs [20]. In any case, more research should be done to investigate the critical factors and the molecular components determining EV uptake and targeting. One of the challenges associated with EVs as future drug delivery vehicles is their capacity to load drugs efficiently. Different methods for loading therapeutic cargo into EVs (electroporation, transfection, cell activation, and incubation) have been assessed, reviewed in [7]. In this study, we incubated EVs with PtX to load them with the drug by passive diffusion, taking advantage of the high lipophilicity of PtX, with a log P value of 3.96 and very poor aqueous solubility of less than 0.01 mg/mL [21]. This loading strategy yielded an average loading efficiency of 9.2% in all our samples. The efficiency of loading has been shown to depend on the hydrophobic nature of the drug, as no major differences were found between passive diffusion and electroporation of hydrophobic porphyrins into EVs [22]. Also, the small size of the molecules, e.g. doxorubicin [23,24], PtX [18] or curcumin [9,25], loaded by this technique may facilitate their passage across the vesicle membrane [7]. These same properties, however, may allow the molecules to move out of the EVs. In a study by Smyth et al. [24], it was reported that after 24 h approximately 70% of doxorubicin incorporated into EVs by passive diffusion had leaked out. When measured by UPLC, the leakage of PtX from the EVs in our study was minimal, which could be dependent on the poorer water solubility of PtX. Another EV loading method that has been successfully exploited is the feeding of desired compounds, including PtX, to cultured cells [12,17] or genetically engineering them to produce RNA or proteins [3,11], which then become partially incorporated into the secreted EVs. While this approach is also nondestructive, the loading is difficult to control and it might affe ble saturation point of PtX-EVs by testing concentrations of PtX-EVs over a wide scale, and an EV concentration below the saturation point to optimize EV-mediated PtX uptake. The identified saturation point was consistently 109 PtX-EVs/mL, at which point the maximal cytotoxic effect was reached. Subsequently, using a lower concentration of EVs increased the cytotoxic effect of PtX compared to the free drug. On the other hand, EV concentrations above the saturation point generally had a less cytotoxic effect compared to the free PtX. These results suggested that a combination of a high amount of drug per vesicle and a number of EVs below the saturation point generate the highest cytotoxic effect. The UPLC measurements of PtX carried by EVs suggested that a similar amount of the drug could bind to 20K MVs and the 110K EXOs during the PtX-loading in the high- and low EV-concentration containing conditions. However, to produce the enhanced cytotoxic effect on the autologous PCa cells, the 110K EXOs required a higher PtX/EXO ratio, whereas the 20K MVs had a similar cytotoxicity enhancing effect regardless of the PtX/MV ratio. A possible explanation for this difference could be that the 110K EXOs were more effective at increasing the viability of cancer cells and thereby partially counteract the effect of PtX. However, since the uptake of unloaded EVs by cancer cells continued over 48 h, it could be presumed that eventually all of the drug would be taken up by the cells via the EVs, which should then lead to the same result as with less EVs. It is possible that PtX might eventually inhibit the uptake of additional PtX-EVs by stabilizing the microtubules of the recipient cells, which would hinder the endocytic pathway [26]. The enhanced cytotoxic effect of PtX-EVs could not be explained by the presence of free PtX. Firstly, no detectable leaking of free PtX from the loaded EVs was observed, although small residues may have been present in our PtX-EV preparations regardless of their washing. Secondly, incubating cells with 5 μM free PtX and EVs without PtX-loading (Fig. S2.A) only resulted in a lag of the PtX-induced cytotoxicity without enhancing it. Currently, we have no explanation why EVs can enhance the cytotoxic effect of PtX. The answer could be that EVs are able to carry more drug into the cells than what the cells gather from the surrounding medium as has been shown earlier [12]. Another possible explanation for the enhanced cytotoxicity could be that the EVs deliver the drug into an optimal subcellular location. Besides β-tubulin, PtX has another binding target, Bcl-2, an apoptosis regulator [27], which is a membrane protein found in the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum, nucleus and mitochondria. By binding to Bcl-2, PtX has been shown to promote apoptosis [27], and by bringing the drug to the proximity of Bcl-2, EVs might enhance its cytotoxic effect. Consistent with our microscopy studies, it has previously been shown that EVs are delivered into the cell primarily by the endocytic pathway [26]. Here, we also showed that PtX was carried into the cells by EVs through endocytosis and that PtX dissociated from the EVs inside the cells, which lead to an uneven distribution of the drug from within the cell cytosol. Although the EVs as delivery vehicles could enhance the cytotoxic effect of PtX, there may be risks involved with their use for clinical purposes. As shown here, and consistent with the findings of others [5], the cancer cell-derived unloaded EVs increased the viability of cancer cells. The effect was more notable in the case of 110K EXOs, which seemed to enhance cell viability more than 20K MVs, and a larger dose of the drug was required to counteract this viability increasing effect. In contrast, EVs from non-cancerous cells may be capable of suppressing tumor proliferation [28], which would make them an attractive alternative to cancer cell-derived EVs [17,18]. On the other hand, several functional studies have shown that EVs derived from tumor cells may adopt the same repertoire of surface receptors and extracellular matrix-binding proteins as their parental cell of origin [3,29], which is different from those of non-malignant cells. This could be used as an advantage to increase the specificity of targeting and uptake to tumor tissues. However, there could still be collateral damage in the form of macrophages, which can also devour EVs hindering delivery to cancer cells and dying as a result [12,30]. Finally, another important aspect for using EVs as drug carriers is that the EV-mediated cancer cell targeting could help to reduce the side effects of the drugs [12]. Therefore further studies, especially in vivo models, need to be developed for the improved targeting and pharmacokinetics of cancer-derived EVs as drug delivery vehicles. 5. Conclusions As a proof of concept, we have demonstrated in this study that autologous cancer cell-derived EVs could be useful drug delivery vehicles in the treatment of cancer, since the EV-mediated delivery enhanced the cytotoxic effect of the used drug, PtX. A relatively small concentration of EVs loaded with a higher amount of PtX generated the best cytotoxic effect in autologous cells. Although the uptake of EVs was found to be continuous, a saturation point in the cytotoxicity of PtX-EVs could be identified. Despite the slight differences between the two EV populations isolated by the standard ultracentrifugation technique, the 20K MVs and the 110K EXOs were almost equally effective, capable of promoting the cytotoxicity of PtX even after the removal of their surface proteins.

19	1996	Preparation and characterization of conjugates of(modified) human serum albumin and liposomes: drug carriers with an intrinsic anti-HIV activity 	Human serum albumin (HSA) derivatized with cis-aconitic anhydride (Aco-HSA) that was earlier shown to inhibit replication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), was covalently coupled to conventional liposomes, consisting of phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol and maleimido-4-(p-phenylbutyryl)phosphatidylethanolamine, using the heterobifunctional reagent N-succinimidyl-Sacetylthioacetate (SATA). The amount of HSA that could be coupled to the liposomes depended on derivatization of the HSA and ranged from 64.2 +_ 9.2 /xg HSA//zmol total lipid for native HSA to 29.5 _+ 2.7/xg HSA//xmol total lipid for HSA in which 53 of the e amino groups of lysine were derivatized with cis-aconitic anhydride (Aco53-HSA). Incorporation of 3.8 mol% of total lipid of a poly(ethylene glycol) derivative of phosphatidylethanolamine (PEG-PE) in the liposomes resulted in a lower coupling efficiency of Aco-HSA. The elimination and distribution of the liposomal conjugates in rats in vivo was largely dependent on the modification of the HSA coupled to the liposomes. With native HSA-liposomes, more than 70% of the conjugate was still found in the blood plasma 30 min after i.v. injection in rats, while at this time Aco-HSA-liposomes were completely cleared from the circulation. The rapid clearance of conventional Aco-HSA-liposomes was due to a rapid uptake into the liver and could be considerably decreased by incorporating PEG-PE in the liposomal bilayer. After 3 h 60% of Aco-HSA-PEG-liposome conjugates were found in the blood. In an in vitro anti-HIV-1 assay, the 50% inhibitory concentrations (ICso) for Aco39-HSA-liposomes and Ac%3-HSA-liposomes expressed as protein weight, were 2.87 /zg/ml and 0.154/xg/ml, respectively. When PEG-PE was incorporated, the Aco53-HSA-liposomes retained anti HIV-1 activity (IC~0: 3.13 /~g/ml). The possibility to modulate the residence time in the bloodstream of Aco-HSA-liposomes and the potent anti-HIV-I activity of these conjugates, may allow the development of an intrinsically active drug carrier system. By incorporating anti HIV- 1 drugs such as AZT into such liposomes a drug delivery system can be designed that might act simultaneously on the virus/cell binding by virtue of the coupled Aco-HSA and on the RNA/DNA transcription of the HIV-I replication cycle through the nucleoside analogue.   aconitic anhydride (Aco-HSA) proved to be a very potent inhibitor of HIV-l-induced cytopathogenicity [1]. The mechanism of action of these compounds is at the level of the binding and fusion of the virus with the target cells. The negatively charged HSA's have been proposed as potential carriers for 3'-azido-Y-deoxythymidine (AZT)- like drugs to T-lymphocytes and monocyte/macrophages. Such preparations may provide inhibition of HIV replication at the level of virus/cell fusion, syncytium formation as well as RNA reverse transcription [4]. AZT in the monophosphate (AZT-MP) form can be coupled directly to modified albumins yielding l to 6 molecules of AZT-MP per protein molecule [4]. Another approach to combine nucleoside analogues or other drugs with the negatively charged albumins, is by coupling these proteins to liposomes, which thus may function as high-capacity carriers for the chosen antiviral agent. Liposomes have been proven to be a suitable delivery system for various kinds of therapeutics, including immune modulators, cytostatics, virostatics and antimicrobial agents [5-9]. Liposomes have also been used as carriers for anti-HIV-1 nucleoside analogues [10] and for prodrugs of nucleoside analogues [11,12]. These and other studies have shown that the antiviral activity of liposomal anti-HIV-1 nucleoside analogues can be preserved or even enhanced as compared to the free drug, while also reduced toxicity has been reported for such formulations [13]. Furthermore, the in vivo behaviour of liposomes can be modulated by incorporation of compounds like ganglioside GM1 or lipophilic derivatives of poly(ethylene glycol) to provide for a prolonged blood circulation time [14,15]. Several methods have been described for the covalent coupling of proteins to liposomes [16,17]. A widely used method, developed in our Institute, is based upon the reaction of sulfhydryl groups of thiolated proteins with maleimide residues incorporated in liposomes [18]. In this paper we describe the preparation of liposome conjugates of native HSA and of HSA, partially derivatized with cis-aconitic anhydride. Succinimidyl-Sthioacetate (SATA) was used to covalently couple the proteins to conventional or PEG-containing liposomes. The conjugates were chemically characterized and their disposition in rats was subsequently investigated. To verify whether the Aco-HSA liposome conjugates had antiviral activity and could be potentially used for a dual attack on the HIV-1 life cycle, we determined the effect of HSAcoupled liposomes on HIV-1 replication in vitro. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Materials Egg yolk phosphatidylcholine (PC), and maleimido-4- (p-phenylbutyryl)phosphatidylethanolamine (MPB-PE) were purchased from Avanti Polar lipids (Birmingham AL, USA). Human serum albumin fraction V (HSA) was obtained from the Central Laboratory of the Red Cross (Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Cholesterol (Chol), Nsuccinimidyl-S-acetylthioacetate (SATA) and cis-aconitic anhydride were from Sigma (St. Louis MO, USA). Iodine125 (125I) and [3H]cholesteryloleyl ether were obtained from Amersham (Buckinghamshire, UK). Poly(ethylene glycol)-distearoylphosphatidylethanolamine (PEG-DSPE), synthesized from poly(ethylene glycol) with an average molecular weight of 1900 and distearoylphosphatidylethanolamine, was a generous gift of Liposome Technology (Menlo Park, CA, USA) through Dr. T.M. Allen. All other chemicals were analytical grade or the best grade available. Polycarbonate filters for liposome extrusion were obtained from Costar (Cambridge, MA, USA). 2.2. Methods 2.2.1. Preparation of cis-aconitic anhydride modified human serum albumin (Aco-HSA) Ten mg of HSA were dissolved in 10 ml 0.2 M K2HPO 4, pH 8.0. To obtain partially derivatized HSA's, variable amounts of solid cis-aconitic anhydride were added and the solution was stirred until all cis-aconitic anhydride was dissolved. The pH was kept at 8-8.5, using 3 M NaOH. Modified HSA was purified by Sephadex G-50 filtration. The modified albumins were characterized by protein determination according to Lowry [19] and estimation of free e amino groups according to Habeeb [20]. The relative net charge of the modified albumins and the percentage monomers and dimers were determined as described before [1]. Shortly, this was done using a fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) system equipped with a mono-Q anion exchange column (Pharmacia; Uppsala, Sweden) or a Superose-12 column (Pharmacia), respectively. HSA was produced in which 39.0 + 2.0 (mean + S.D. of three batches) of the 60 e amino groups were derivatized with cis-aconitic anhydride (Aco39-HSA), and another in which 52.7 + 1.5 (mean + S.D. of three batches) of the • amino groups were derivatized (Aco53-HSA). 2.2.2. Liposome preparation Lipids from stock solutions of PC, Chol and MPB-PE in chloroform/methanol (9:1), were mixed in a molar ratio of 23:16:1, dried under reduced nitrogen pressure, dissolved in cyclohexane and lyophilized. The lipids were hydrated in HN-buffer (10 mM N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N'-2-ethanesulfonic acid (Hepes), 135 mM NaC1, pH 6.7), under mechanical agitation. The liposomes were then sized by repeated extrusion (13 times) through polycarbonate filters (Costar, Cambridge MA, USA), pore size 50 nm, using a high pressure extruder (Lipex, Vancouver, Canada). When appropriate, 0.04 mol PEGwoo-DSPE (PEG) was added to the lipid mixture per mol of phospholipid. When required, liposomes were radiolabeled with a tracer amount of [3H]cholesteryloleyl ether, which was included in the  amount of cholesterol present in the liposome preparations. Size and size distribution of the liposomes were determined by dynamic laser light scattering with a Nicomp model 370 submicron particle analyzer (NICOMP particle sizing systems, Santa Barbara, CA, USA). The diameter of the liposome preparations was obtained from the volume distribution curves produced by the particle analyzer. 2,2.3. Coupling of liSA or Aco-HSA to liposomes HSA or Aco-HSA was coupled to MPB-PE liposomes by a sulfhydryl-maleimide coupling technique as described before [18], with minor modifications. Briefly, free sulfhydryl groups were introduced in HSA or Aco-HSA, as described by Duncan et al. [22], using N-succinimidyl-Sacetylthioacetate (SATA) as a heterobifunctional reagent. After separation of free SATA from the protein by gel permeation chromatography, acetylthioacetate-(Aco)-HSA was deacetylated by addition of 100 /zl of a freshly prepared solution of 0.5 M hydroxylamine-HC1, 0.5 M Hepes, 25 mM EDTA, pH 7.0 per ml of protein solution and free sulfhydryl groups were determined according to Ellman [23]. After deacetylation, the thioacetyl-(Aco)-HSA was allowed to react for 4 h at room temperature with the MPB-PE containing liposomes in a ratio of 3 mg of protein per 10 /xmol total lipid. N-Ethylmaleimide (8 mM in HN buffer) was added to cap unreacted sulfhydryl groups [18]. Liposomes were separated from unconjugated protein by flotation on a metrizamide gradient. 2 ml of the liposome mixture were mixed with 2.5 ml of a 60% metrizamide solution containing 10 mM Hepes, 6.7 mM KC1 and 1.2 mM CaC12, pH 7.6. This solution was gently overlaid with 0.7 ml HN buffer and then centrifuged at 150000 × g, 4°C, in a Beckman SW 50.1 swing out rotor. The liposomes were collected between the buffer and the metrizamide layer, after which the separation procedure was repeated. The protein-liposome conjugates were then extensively dialyzed against HN buffer, pH 7.4. Control liposomes were prepared from the same lipid mixture but, instead of being incubated with (Aco)-HSA, they were incubated with cysteine in a molar amount twice that of MPB-PE to block reactive maleimido groups on the liposome surface. The (Aco)-HSA-liposome conjugates were characterized by determining protein [24] and phospholipid phosphorus content [21] and by particle size analysis. In some experiments HSA was labeled with 125I as described by McFarlane [25] before starting the coupling procedure. Experiments with the (Aco)-HSA-liposome conjugates were performed within 1 week after preparation. 2.2.4. Serum disappearance, liver uptake and tissue distribution of liposomes When in vivo experiments were performed with a duration of 30 min, male Wag-Rij rats (200-250 g) were anaesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of 20-25 mg sodium pentobarbital. Radiolabeled liposomes were injected via the penile vein and the abdomen was opened. As 100% value for the injected dose the actual amount of radioactivity injected was taken (corrected for radioactivity remaining in the needle, syringe and tube). At the indicated times, blood samples were taken from the inferior vena cava and allowed to clot for 60 rain, at 4°C. The samples were centrifuged (5' at 13000×g). The total amount of radioactivity in the serum was calculated using the equation: serum volume (ml) = (0.0219 × body weight (g)) + 2.66 [26]. At the indicated times, liver lobules were excised and weighed. The total amount of liver tissue tied off did not exceed 15% of the total liver weight. Radioactivity in the liver was corrected for radioactivity present in serum at the time of sampling (85 /xl serum/g of wet weight) [27]. When indicated, other tissues were removed and weighed at the end of the experiment. The tissues were homogenized using a Potter Elvehjem tube. Radioactivity was determined after solubilization of 0.4 ml of the homogenate in 100 /xl 10% SDS and 4 ml scintillation cocktail. Radioactivity in the tissues was corrected for radioactivity originating from their plasma contents [27]. When experiments were performed with PEG-liposomes, rats were injected via the penile vein under light diethylether anesthesia. At the indicated time points blood samples were taken from the tail vein. At 3 h the rats were anesthetized and liver and spleen were removed and treated as described above. 2.2.5. Cells and virus MT-4 cells, a T 4 lymphocyte cell line harbouring human T-cell lymphotropic virus type-1 (HTLV-1) [28], were used for the anti-HIV-1 assay. The MT-4 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and 20 /xg/ml gentamycin. The cells were maintained at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO 2 in air. Every 3-4 days, cells were centrifuged and seeded at 2.105 cells/ml in new culture flasks. At regular time intervals, the cells were analyzed for the presence of mycoplasma and were consistently found to be mycoplasma free. HIV-1 (strain HTLVIII B) [29] was obtained from the culture supernatant of persistently HIV-1 infected HUT-78 cells. The virus titer of the supernatant was determined in MT-4 cells. The virus stock was stored at -70°C until used. 2.2.6. Antiviral assay Antiviral activity of the test compounds was assessed by measurement of viability of MT-4 cells that had been infected or not infected with HIV-1 and exposed to various concentrations of the test compounds. The viability of the cells was examined spectrophotometrically by the 3-(4,5- dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) method as described in more detail previously [30]. The cytotoxicity of the compounds was also monitored by the MTT assay.   3. Results 3.1. Synthesis and characterization of (Aco)-HSA-liposomes (Aco)-HSA was coupled to MPB-PE-containing liposomes with a diameter of 74.7 nm after extrusion through 50-nm polycarbonate filters (Table 1). When 3.8 mol% of total lipid PEG-DSPE was incorporated into the liposomes, a diameter of 77.4 nm was obtained after extrusion. Coupling of the different HSA preparations to the liposomes led to a significant increase of the particle diameter (P < 0.05) in all cases. Coupling of the heterobifunctional reagent SATA to the proteins resulted in the introduction of 4.5 to 5.4 sulfhydryl groups. Per albumin molecule the number of sulfhydryl groups introduced in the protein tended to decrease with the degree of derivatization with cis-aconific anhydride. The amount of protein that could be coupled to the liposomes was therefore higher for native HSA than for Aco-HSA. For native HSA-liposomes a number 45 HSA molecules per liposome was calculated, assuming a molecular weight of HSA of 69 000 and assuming that 1 /zmol liposomal lipid contains 48 000 liposomes [31]. Derivatization of HSA with either 39 molecules or 53 molecules of cis-aconitic anhydride did not significantly affect the amount of protein that could be coupled to either liposome type. However, slightly more Aco-HSA could be coupled covalently to conventional liposomes as compared to the PEG-liposomes. The liposome conjugates were stable for at least 4 weeks at 4°C, with respect to size and to the amount of protein coupled. The in vivo stability of the conjugates was determined by comparing the liver uptake and serum decay of HSA-liposome conjugates which were either labeled in conjugates, as compared to control liposomes. At 10 rain after injection, more than 95% of both the Aco39-HSA and Aco53-HSA-liposomes had disappeared from the blood plasma, while with control liposomes 88% was still present. There was no significant difference in clearance between Aco39-HSA and Ac%3-HSA-liposomes. Incorporation of 3.8 mol% of total lipid PEG-DSPE in the liposomes could largely overcome the fast clearance from the circulation of conventional Aco-HSA-liposomes (Fig. 3). At 30 min after injection 85% of the injected dose of Aco39-HSA-PEG-liposomes and 70% of Aco53-HSAPEG-liposomes were still present in the blood. In the first 30 min after injection of the conjugates, there was a significant difference in the plasma levels of Aco39-HSAPEG-liposomes and Aco53-HSA-PEG-liposomes (P< 0,005), while after this time point the clearance of the two conjugates from the plasma was comparable up to 3 h. After 3 h of circulation about 60% of the Aco-HSA-PEGliposomes was still found in the plasma, while about 70% of the control liposomes was recovered from the blood. 3.3. Tissue distribution of Aco-HSA-liposomes The [3H]cholesteryloleyl ether-labeled Aco-HSA-liposomes were mainly recovered in the liver and to a lesser extent in the spleen (Table 2). Other organs tested for radioactivity, such as kidney, lung and heart, did not show any significant uptake of Aco-HSA-liposomes (results not shown). At 30 min after i.v. injection of the conventional Aco39-HSA- and Aco53-HSA-liposomes, 80% was taken up by the liver, while the spleen accounted for 3% of the injected dose of these liposomes. When PEG-DSPE was incorporated in the Aco-HSA-liposomes, the liver remained the main site of uptake. However, at 3 h after administration of Aco39-HSA- or Aco53-HSA-PEG-lipoTable 2 Tissue distribution of HSA-PEG)-liposomes conventional (Aco-HSA)-liposomes and (AcoLiposome Time Distribution (% of injected dose) composition (min) spleen liver serum C-lip 30 4.6+3.3 4.9+ 5.6 80.2+4.9 Aco39-HSA-li p 30 2.9+0.5 79.8+ 18.3 2.5+3.6 Aco53-HSA-li p 30 3.1 + 1.5 79.6+20.0 2.8+3.4 PEG-lip 180 9.1 +0.9 4.2+ 2.1 70.0+2.6 Aco39-HSA-PEG-Ii p 180 3.2+0.3 21.9+ 0.9 62.3+1.8 Aco53-HSA-PEG-Ii p 180 2.6+0.7 26.6+ 3.3 57.7+5.8 [3H]Cholesteryloleyl ether-labeled liposomes were injected into anesthetized rats.

Spleen uptake of Aco-HSAPEG-liposomes was lower than of control PEG-liposomes, but in the same range as that found for Aco-HSA-liposomes. Control PEG-liposomes were taken up by the spleen to a two-fold larger extent than by the liver, in line with earlier observations [32]. The total recovery of radioactivity from the tissues and fluids studied was always higher than 85% of the injected dose. 3.4. Anti-HIV-I activity of Aco-HSA-Iiposomes Table 3 shows the antiviral activities of Aco39-HSA, Aco53-HSA and the different Aco-HSA liposome conjugates tested against HIV-1, in vitro. The IC50 values of the conventional Aco39-HSA and Aco53-HSA liposomes were 2.87 and 0.15 /xg of protein/ml, respectively. Free Aco39- HSA and Aco53-HSA were 3 to 4 times more effective against HIV-1 replication in MT4 cells than the liposomal conjugates. Incorporation of PEG-DSPE in the liposomes resulted in a significant loss of antiviral activity of the Aco-HSA liposome conjugates, but with Aco53-HSAPEG-liposomes still an IC50 of 3.13 /xg of protein/ml was    ciable anti-HIV-1 activity. Control liposomes without AcoHSA coupled, did not show any anti-HIV-1 activity (resuits not shown). The conjugates did not appear to be cytotoxic to MT4 cells at the concentrations used in the anti-HIV-1 assay. However, the cell toxicity (CC50) and the selectivity index (SI) of the liposomal formulations could not be accurately determined, since the limited amount of protein that can be coupled to the liposomes did not allow testing of high protein concentrations in the cytotoxicity assay. 4. Discussion In this report we describe the preparation and characterization of a liposomal drug carrier system with a potent intrinsic anti-HIV-1 activity. HSA and negatively charged Aco-HSA were covalently coupled to small type liposomes using the heterobifunctional reagent N-succinimidyl-Sacetylthioacetate. This is a well established method for coupling proteins to liposomes, based upon the reaction of thiolated proteins and liposomal maleimido-4-(p-phenylbutyryl)phosphatidylethanolamine [18,33,34]. The number of sulfhydryl groups that could be introduced in HSA or Aco-HSA was reproducible. Thiolation of Aco53-HSA, in which 53 of the free e-amino groups of lysine were derivatized with cis-aconitic anhydride, still allowed the introduction of 4.8 sulfhydryl molecules in this protein. This indicates that SATA is also very suitable for coupling highly derivatized proteins to liposomes. The amount of protein that could be coupled to the liposomes was significantly lower for the Aco-HSA than for native HSA. This may be due to the relatively strong negative charge of Aco-HSA [1], which may cause electrostatic repulsion. Incorporation of PEG-DSPE in the liposomes resulted in a slightly lower coupling efficiency of Aco-HSA. This is probably caused by steric hindrance by PEG at the liposome surface. Taking in account the serum decay and liver uptake patterns of HSA-liposomes, which were labeled either with 1251 in the protein moiety or with [3H]cholesteryloleyl ether in the lipid moiety, it can be concluded that the covalent bond between the liposome and the coupled protein remains intact in the circulation. Both Aco39-HSA- and Aco53-HSA-liposomes are rapidly cleared from the blood, while control liposomes show a very slow plasma disappearance. The rapid removal of the Aco-HSA-liposomes from the blood stream is associated with a high liver uptake. Spleen uptake of the liposomes was not affected by coupling of Aco-HSA. Low amounts of negatively charged succinylated HSA (SucHSA) [35] and Aco-HSA (Swart, P.J. et al., unpublished data) have also been shown to be taken up rapidly by the liver. This further substantiates that the in vivo behaviour of the Aco-HSA-liposomes is determined predominantly by the coupled protein and not by the lipid part of the conjugate. Incorporation of phospholipid derivatives of PEG in liposomes has been shown to prolong the blood circulation time of liposomes [15]. Inhibition of the specific and/or non specific interaction between PEG modified liposomes and the mononuclear phagocyte system have been invoked to explain these favourable characteristics. At 3 h after injection of Aco39-HSA-PEG- and Ac%3-HSA-PEG-liposomes blood concentrations were only 10% lower than the blood levels of control PEG-liposomes at that time. This indicates that incorporation of 3.8 mol% of total lipid PEG1900-DSPE in the liposomes can largely overcome the effect of Aco-HSA on the residence time in the blood stream. Similar to what we observed with the conventional liposomes, the clearance of Aco-HSA-PEG-liposomes is mainly due to liver uptake of the conjugates. However, as compared to control PEG-liposomes the uptake by the spleen is significantly lower for Aco-HSA-PEG-liposomes than for control PEG-liposomes. This might be explained by the active involvement of the scavenger removal system in rat liver. Negatively charged proteins, including negatively charged HSA, have been demonstrated to be taken up very efficiently by the liver through scavenger receptors on liver endothelial cells and Kupffer cells [36]. When Aco-HSA-PEG-liposomes are accommodated by such scavenger receptors, this may cause a shift from splenic to hepatic uptake as compared to control PEG-liposomes. Recently, it has been shown that Aco-HSA, with an IC50 of 0.02 /zg/ml, is one of the most potent in vitro anti-HIV-1 agents described to date [1]. Furthermore AcoHSA does not show unwanted side effects, such as anticoagulant activity, which has been described for dextran sulfate, a polyanion which also exhibits anti-HIV-1 activity [1]. The antiviral effect of Aco-HSA is rather specific for HIV-1 and the mechanism of action appears to be at the level of virus-cell binding and particularly on the fusion of the virus with the cell membrane. It has been postulated that these negatively charged albumins interact with the gp 41 envelope glycoprotein or may bind to the V3 loop of gp 120 [4]. These results were obtained with Aco-HSA in which all 60 amino groups of lysine were derivatized with cis-aconitic anhydride. The present study shows that the partially derivatized Aco39-HSA and Aco53-HSA still display a potent anti-HIV-1 activity of 1.08 /xg/ml and 0.04 /~g/ml, respectively. The observed difference in anti-HIV1 activity between fully derivatized HSA and partially derivatized HSA indicates that the activity of these proteins is dependent on the degree of derivatization. This finding is in agreement with data which show that the anti-viral effect of negatively charged proteins correlates directly with the density of negative charges [3]. After coupling to conventional liposomes, the acylated proteins retain their anti-HIV-1 activity, although the antiviral activity decreases. When PEG-DSPE was incorporated in the liposomal bilayer no anti-HIV-1 activity could even be detected for Aco39-HSA-PEG-liposomes, but for Ac%3-HSA-PEG liposomes still an IC5o of 3.13 /zg/ml  difference between Aco39-HSA-PEG liposomes and Aco53-HSA-PEG liposomes we suggest that the difference in antiviral activity is due to differences in acylation, while the decrease in anti-HIV activity as compared to conventional Aco-HSA liposomes may be caused by steric hindrance of the poly(ethylene glycol) on the surface of the liposomes. With Aco53-HSA-PEG-liposomes a dual attack on the life cycle of HIV-1 might be accomplished: firstly, on the binding/fusion of the virus with the cell membrane by means of the coupled Aco-HSA and, secondly, on the reverse transcriptase by including anti-HIV-1 nucleoside analogues. Apart from a potential dual attack on virus replication, there is evidence of synergistic effects of polyanionic compounds and nucleoside analogues [37,38]. It is of interest that in a previous report [39] liposomal preparations were described with an anti-HIV activity in which charge modification was not obtained by coupling of polyanionic proteins, but through inclusion of negatively charged lipids. The present results confirm the ability of net negatively charged liposomes to inhibit HIV-1 replication in vitro. Since Aco53-HSA-PEG liposomes have a long circulation time in blood, this conjugate may prove to be attractive as carriers for anti-HIV-agents to T-lymphocytes and monocytes/macrophages. Macrophages have been shown to endocytose polyanionic molecules including acylated proteins. Recent studies also indicate the presence of binding sites for negatively charged proteins on T-lymphocytes [4]. Recently, it was reported that both liver parenchymal and sinusoidal cells can be infected by HIV-1 in vivo [40]. In general, liposomes are avidly taken up by the liver, especially by the macrophages. Therefore, since both conventional as well as Aco-HSA-PEG-liposomes are, at least to some extent, taken up by the liver, they may be suitable carriers for the targeting of anti-HIV-1 drugs to various liver cells. We are currently investigating the mechanisms by which liver cell types take up Aco-HSA-liposome conjugates. In conclusion, the procedure for coupling Aco-HSA to liposomes is reproducible and the conjugates seem to be stable after injection in vivo. The possibility to modulate the in vivo disposition of Aco-HSA-liposomes combined with the anti-HIV-1 activity of these conjugates, allows the development of a potent drug carrier system with a dual anti HIV-I activity. Currently, studies are in progress in our laboratories to determine possible synergistic antiviral effects of anti-HIV-1 nucleoside analogues and Aco-HSAliposomes as their delivery system. 	Jan A.A.M.

20	1999	Interactions of elastic and rigid vesicles with human skin in vitro: electron microscopy and two-photon excitation microscopy	Abstract Interactions between vesicle formulations and human skin were studied, in vitro, in relation to their composition and elasticity. The skin ultrastructure was investigated using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), freeze-fracture electron microscopy (FFEM) and two-photon fluorescence microscopy (TPE). The main difference between the vesicle formulations was their elasticity. Elastic vesicle formulations contained bilayer forming surfactants/lipids and single-chain surfactant octaoxyethylenelaurate-ester (PEG-8-L), whereas rigid vesicles contained bilayer surfactants in combination with cholesterol. TEM results showed three types of interactions after non-occlusive application of elastic PEG-8-L containing vesicle formulations on human skin: (1) the presence of spherical lipid structures containing or surrounded by electron dense spots; (2) oligolamellar vesicles were observed between the corneocytes in the upper part of the stratum corneum; and (3) large areas containing lipids, surfactants and electron dense spots were observed deeper down into the stratum corneum. Furthermore, after treatment with vesicles containing PEG-8-L and a saturated C12-chain surfactant, small stacks of bilayers were found in intercellular spaces of the stratum corneum. Rigid vesicles affected only the most apical corneocytes to some extent. FFEM observations supported the TEM findings. Major morphological changes in the intercellular lipid bilayer structure were only observed after treatment with PEG-8-L containing elastic vesicles. TPE showed a distinct difference in penetration pathways after non-occlusive application of elastic or rigid vesicles. After treatment with elastic vesicles, threadlike channels were formed within the entire stratum corneum and the polygonal cell shape of corneocytes could not be distinguished. Fluorescent label incorporated in rigid vesicles was confined to the intercellular spaces of the upper 2^5 Wm of the stratum corneum and the cell contours could still be distinguished. ß 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

The stratum corneum is regarded as a heterogeneous two-compartment system composed of keratin-¢lled corneocytes, embedded in a lipid-en  is located within the lipid lamellae in the intercellular spaces of the stratum corneum [1^7]. The lipid lamellae are formed by rearrangement of lamellar disks that are extruded from the uppermost cells of the stratum granulosum [4]. To broaden the spectrum of drugs delivered via the skin and to increase e¤cacy of systemic treatment, there is a demand for new transdermal drug delivery systems. Vesicles have been developed as possible carriers in transdermal drug targeting by facilitating the transdermal drug transport through speci¢c interactions with skin. It has been suggested that skin^vesicle interactions are in£uenced by both, chemical characteristics of vesicles, e.g. their composition and charge, and physical, such as physical state, lamellarity, and size [8^12]. In addition, interactions are also in£uenced by the application method, such as occlusive or non-occlusive application [13], and general skin conditions. There is still debate concerning the mechanisms by which vesicles facilitate (trans)dermal di¡usion of drugs. So far, three main mechanisms have been described by which vesicles interact with the stratum corneum: (1) penetration of intact vesicles into the stratum corneum where the vesicles either localize [14] or pass on to the dermis [15]; (2) adsorption or fusion of vesicles on the surface of the skin [10,16]; and (3) penetration of vesicle constituents into the skin which may a¡ect the ultrastructure of the intercellular regions in the stratum corneum [17,18]. Most of the research involving both the investigation of mechanisms by which vesicles interact with skin as well as their use as drug carriers for transdermal drug delivery has focussed on vesicles composed of phospholipids (liposomes) or non-ionic surfactants (niosomes). Fluidization of intercellular domains and thus a structural modi¢cation of the stratum corneum has been suggested as a possible mechanism for the enhanced drug transport of encapsulated drugs in vesicles. Stratum corneum may also act as a reservoir for topically applied substances [19] and can be studied to elucidate the mechanism involved in (trans)dermal transport [20]. Techniques to penetration pathways of either vesicle constituents or (model) drugs are confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) [6,21] or two-photon excitation microscopy (TPE). Techniques to study the mechanisms involved in vesicle^skin interactions are transmission electron microscopy (TEM) [16,22], freeze-fracture electron microscopy (FFEM) [6,10, 23], X-ray di¡raction and electron spin resonance (ESR) [9,17]. On the basis of physicochemical considerations, Cevc [24] developed elastic vesicles, named Transfersomes, to enhance drug transport through the stratum corneum into the viable epidermis. They postulated that penetration of intact vesicles into the stratum corneum and underlying tissue is possible under certain conditions, i.e. non-occlusive application of elastic vesicles [25]. The hydration driving force for these speci¢c elastic vesicles into the skin is larger than the resistance when passing intercellular lipid regions in the stratum corneum. The driving force is generated by a large hydration gradient across the skin, varying from 15 to 20% in the stratum corneum to 70% in the stratum granulosum. The objective of this study was to elucidate possible mechanisms by which elastic liquid-state vesicles may interact with human skin and hence contribute to transdermal drug delivery. Since the physicochemical characteristics of vesicles in£uence interactions with skin, a number of liquid-state vesicle formulations with varying compositions were investigated. By combining surfactants, which by themselves form bilayers, with micelle forming single-chain surfactants, vesicles can be developed with varying elasticities depending on the molar ratio of the components. It is the simultaneous presence in one membrane of di¡erent stabilizing/destabilizing molecules, and their tendency to redistribute in the bilayers that enables these vesicles to be more elastic compared to conventional liposomes and niosomes [24]. In our studies elastic vesicles were based on the single-chain non-ionic surfactant octaoxyethylenelaurate-ester (PEG-8-L) combined with either egg phosphatidylcholine (EggPC) (unsaturated C18-chain) or sucrose-ester L-595 (saturated C12-chain), with and without cholesterol sulfate, whereas rigid vesicles were composed of either the sucrose-ester L-595 or Wasag-7 (C18), cholesterol and cholesterol sulfate. In  previous studies, we investigated the stability, morphology and elasticity of these vesicle formulations [26]. The vesicles were considered to be elastic when it was possible to extrude the formulations through membranes with 30-nm pores. In the present study, TEM in combination with ruthenium tetroxide (RuO4) and FFEM has been used to visualize interactions of elastic vesicles and rigid vesicles with human skin at an ultrastructural level. In addition to TEM and FFEM, TPE was used to study interactions and penetration pathways of vesicle constituents. TPE is a sensitive technique for the 3D-imaging of skin on a light microscopic level. When using conventional (single-photon) confocal £uorescence microscopy, the scattering of the emitted £uorescence light is a major problem in the visual sectioning of £uorescence as a function of skin depth. By using a longer wavelength, TPE reduces this scattering and the penetration depth is therefore increased. Furthermore, in single-photon imaging, bleaching occurs over the whole illumination cone while in TPE, photobleaching is con¢ned to the focal volume. When scans are made at di¡erent axial positions bleaching in two-photon microscopy is reduced considerably and makes TPE the preferred tool for direct visualization of di¡usion of £uorescent molecules through skin. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Materials The sucrose-ester Wasag-7 was purchased from Schmidt (Amsterdam, The Netherlands), whereas the sucrose laurate-ester L-595 was a gift from Mitsubishi Kasei (Tokyo, Japan). Wasag-7 consists of 70% stearate-ester and 30% palmitate-ester (40% mono, 60% di/tri-ester) (HLB = 7); L-595 consists of 100% laurate-ester (30% mono-, 40% di-, 30% tri-ester) (HLB = 7). The polyoxyethylene laurate ester PEG-8-L was a gift from Lipo Chemicals (Paterson, NJ, USA). Cholesterol (Chol) and cholesterol sulfate (CS) were purchased from Sigma (Hilversum, The Netherlands). Egg phosphatidylcholine (EggPC) was obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Pelham, AL, USA). The bu¡er used was a phosphate bu¡ered saline (PBS) pH 7.4 (8 mM Na2HPO4, 1.5 mM KH2PO4, 139 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl in millipore water). Fluorescein-DHPE was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR, USA). 2.2. Preparation of vesicle formulations The composition and molar ratio of vesicle formulations is shown in Table 1. Vesicles were prepared by a modi¢cation of the sonication method described by Baillie et al. [27]. The surfactants, cholesterol and cholesterol sulfate were solubilized in chloroform/ methanol (3:1 v/v). Subsequently, the solvent was evaporated by leading a N2-stream in tubes containing the solvent at 40³C and the remaining surfactant ¢lm was hydrated with PBS pH 7.4. The ¢nal formulation contained 5% (w/w) of lipids. Vesicle formulations composed of PEG-8-L:L595:CS and PEG-8-L:EggPC were sonicated for 15 s at room temperature, whereas vesicles composed of Wasag-7 and L-595 in combination with cholesterol and cholesterol sulfate were heated to 80³C to dissolve the lipid ¢lm and sonicated for 45 s. The sonicator used was a Branson Soni¢er 250 (Branson Ultrasonics, Danbury, CT) with an 1/8 in. microtip at 60 Watt energy output. The formulations were cooled down to room temperature and examined for phase separation, vesicle formation and crystal formation using a polarization microscope. The vesicle diameter was between 100 and 150 nm as determined by dy 2.3. Skin preparation Human abdominal skin was obtained after cosmetic surgery and processed the same day. Subcutaneous fat was removed and skin dermatomed to a thickness of approximately 200^250 Wm (Padgett Dermatome, Kansas City, USA). 2.4. Transmission electron microscopy and freeze-fracture electron microscopy Circular pieces of skin (q 18 mm) were placed in Franz-type di¡usion cells with the stratum corneum side facing the donor compartment. The receiver compartment was ¢lled with PBS pH 7.4 and heated to 37³C to establish a temperature of 32³C on the skin surface. Care was taken to prevent the occurrence of air bubbles between the dermal side of skin and receiver solution. Following the mounting of the skin, 50 Wl/cm2 of vesicle formulation was applied to the stratum corneum and carefully spread to achieve complete and homogeneous surface covering. A minimum of two cells using skin from at least two di¡erent donors was used. All experiments were carried out under non-occlusive conditions for a period of 16 h. Skin samples were removed immediately following the 16-h application period and biopsies were taken both for TEM and FFEM. For TEM, biopsies (1U4 mm) were ¢xed at 4³C in Karnovsky's ¢xative overnight and with a combination of osmium tetroxide and ruthenium tetroxide +0.25% (w/v) K3Fe(CN)6 [28]. Following ¢xation, the samples were dehydrated in a range of ethanol solutions (70, 90, 95, 100%) and embedded in Spurr's resin. Ultrathin sections were cut (Ultracut E, Reichert-Jung, Vienna, Austria), collected on formvar coated grids and examined in a Philips 410 (Philips, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) electron microscope. Approximately ¢ve overview and 30^40 detailed micrographs were taken of each treatment and compared with PBS-treated skin. For FFEM, skin samples were processed as described elsewhere [29]. After the freeze-fracture procedure, the replicas were cleaned in 0.5 M ammonium hydroxide in Toluene (Soluene-350, Packard Instrument Company, Meriden, USA) for 5 days. After Soluene treatment, Soluene was removed by washing the replicas with toluene. The replicas were collected on 400 mesh copper grids (Balzers, Liechtenstein) and examined in a Philips EM410 (Philips, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) transmission electron microscope operated at 80 kV. For each treatment, 30^40 micrographs were taken and evaluated. 2.5. Two-photon excitation microscopy TPE was used to visualize the e¡ect of treatment with vesicles on the penetration of a £uorescence label into skin. To visualize the skin structure and morphology, untreated skin was stained for 16 h by submerging the skin in either a £uorescein solution in the absence of vesicles. Skin treated with PEG-8-L:L-595:CS (70:30:5) vesicles, Wasag-7:Chol:CS (50:50:5) vesicles and PEG-8-L micelles was investigated. For vesicles and micelles, the £uorescence label £uorescein-DHPE was incorporated at a molar ratio of 2.75% during the preparation procedure. In total, three skin samples (q 18 mm) of at least three di¡erent donors per vesicle formulation and application period were clamped between donor and receiver compartment of Franz-type di¡usion cells under the same conditions as described above for TEM and FFEM visualization experiments. Vesicle formulation (50 Wl/cm2) was administered non-occlusively for 1, 3, 6 and 16 h, after which, skin samples were removed, washed and sandwiched in between two microscope coverslips without intermediate £uid for imaging. Twophoton £uorescence microscopic images were recorded with the set-up as described by Vroom [30]. xy-Images comprising 256U256 pixels (16 bits) were recorded at di¡erent axial positions in skin. The ¢eld of view of these images was 110U110 Wm2 and the pixel dwell time was 128 Ws. The average power on the sample was approximately 5 mW. The refractive index of the stratum corneum was about 1.55 [31], close to that of immersion oil (nDV1.515). A 60UNA 1.4 oil-immersion objective (Nikon, Japan) was therefore used for the imaging of vesicle transport pathways through skin. The excitation wavelength was 800 nm and leaked stray excitation light in the detection path was blocked by a series of 700 nm short-pass interference ¢lters (Optosigma) and placed in front of the photomultiplier. In obtaining the images, the same settings of the microscope were always used.  3. Results 3.1. Transmission electron microscopy In Fig. 1, representative electron micrographs of PBS-treated skin are shown. The RuO4-¢xation is limited to a maximum of six to eight cell layers from the skin surface downwards. Therefore, lamellae in lower parts of the stratum corneum cannot be visualized and consequently intercellular spaces appear as `empty'. The micrographs in Fig. 1 clearly show corneocytes, £attened cells characterized by Fig. 1. TEM micrographs of human skin incubated non-occlusively with PBS for 16 h.

In intercellular spaces, lipid lamellae are visualized, whereas sebaceous lipids, observed as smooth gray areas, are present on the surface of the stratum corneum and between upper stratum corneum cell layers. Below the stratum corneum, the stratum granulosum can be identi¢ed. Elastic liquid-state vesicles (Fig. 2) appear on the surface of the skin as aggregates ¢lled with lipid material. In Fig. 2a, an overview of skin treated with PEG-8-L:EggPC (30:70) vesicles is presented. This particular area contains a skin wrinkle in which vesicles close to the skin surface have not been washed away during the ¢xation procedure. Vesicle material within the intercellular spaces of the upper three to four corneocytes of the stratum corneum is observed as either: (1) spherical lipid aggregates surrounded by electron dense material; (2) lipid aggregates containing small electron dense spots; or (3) small oligolamellar spherical structures. Occasionally, in the upper 2^3 cell layers, small intracellular lipid aggregates were observed, whereas lipid aggregates fused onto the corneocyte envelope (Fig. 2b). Treatment of skin with 30:70 and 70:30 PEG-8- L:L-595 vesicle formulations induced ultrastructural changes similarly as observed for PEG-8-L:EggPC vesicles. However, in one donor treated with PEG8-L:L-595 (70:30) vesicles, large areas of bilayer stacks were observed di¡erent in appearance than stratum corneum lipid lamellae and were present throughout the entire stratum corneum. In some regions, it was observed that these lamellar stacks disorganized intercellular stratum corneum lipid lamellar stacking (Fig. 3) by pushing them apart. The bilayers in these stacks were occasionally orientated perpendicular to the stacking of the stratum corneum lamellae (Fig. 3c) or when accumulated, they were orientated randomly (Fig. 3d). The addition of CS to PEG-8-L:L-595 did not have an additional e¡ect on the interactions or penetration depth of vesicle material; the same ultrastructural changes were observed as in skin treated with PEG-8-L:L-595 vesicles without CS. Fig. 3e shows a representative example of skin treated with PEG-8-L:L-595:CS (30:70:5) vesicles. After treatment with PEG-8-L:L-595:CS (70:30:5) vesicle formulations similar structures were found (not shown). After treatment with PEG-8-L-containing vesicle formulations, areas of lipids with electron dense material have been visualized deeper down in the stratum corneum that is ¢xed only by OsO4. Since SC lipid lamellae cannot be ¢xed by OsO4 [28], the lipid material has to be originated from the vesicles. These OsO4 ¢xed lipid areas, containing electron dense material (see for example Fig. 3e), have not been observed in PBS-treated skin. No ultrastructural changes were observed in cell layers below the stratum granulosum (not shown). Treatment of skin with L-595:Chol:CS (50:50:5) vesicles revealed the presence of vesicle material on the surface of skin, most likely mixed with sebaceous lipids (not shown). Lipid material with electron dense spots similar to those observed after treatment with elastic liquid^state vesicles were only observed between the upper 2^3 cell layers and not deeper down in the stratum corneum. Wasag-7:Chol:CS (50:50:5) vesicles (Fig. 4) induce no ultrastructural changes in the stratum corneum. 3.2. Freeze-fracture electron microscopy Fig. 5a and b show representative electron micrographs of PBS-treated skin. Keratin ¢laments are shown as particles that entirely ¢ll the interior space of corneocytes, whereas cell organelles are absent. Mostly, the fracture plane in the corneocyte is orientated perpendicular to the skin surface. In intercellu Neither increasing the PEG-8-L content from 30 to 70 mol% nor adding cholesterol sulfate, changed the skin structure modulations induced by vesicles. In addition, no di¡erence in structure modulations was observed in combining the PEG-8-L surfactant with either a saturated C12 surfactant (L-595) or an unsaturated C18 surfactant (EggPC), except for treatment with PEG-8-L:L-595 70:30. Non-occlusive treatment with both L-595:Chol:CS and Wasag7:Chol:CS rigid vesicles did not a¡ect the skin ultrastructure, which illustrates the importance of the presence of elastic bilayers for ultrastructural changes to occur. The crystalline state of stratum corneum lipid lamellae and the existence of hydrogen bonds between the head groups and the absence of swelling make that the SC lipid lamellae have a high cohesion. Schreier and Bouwstra [32] supposed that migration of intact vesicles is unlikely to occur. However, Cevc et al. [24,25] postulated that the combination of both elastic vesicles and non-occlusive application should enable vesicles to penetrate through the stratum corneum under the in£uence of the `hydration force'. This force should be able to drive elastic vesicles into skin when this force is larger than the resistance when passing intercellular lipid regions in the stratum corneum. The driving force is generated by the hydration gradient across the skin, varying from 15 to 20% in the stratum corneum to 70% in the stratum granulosum. Cevc and Blume claimed that elastic vesicles pass individually through pores in skin [25]. The present TEM results, however, illustrate that our elastic vesicles rather disrupt the stacking of the skin lipid lamellae thereby creating dislocations and possible penetration pathways. In addition, after treatment with PEG-8-L:L-595 (70:30) vesicles, we observed lamellar stacks. The appearance of these stacks might be explained as follows. Under the in- £uence of the hydration force, elastic vesicles partition into the stratum corneum, after which due to the elasticity and reduced water content in the stratum corneum the vesicles might easily £atten. When these £attened vesicles fuse together, bilayer stacks are formed. Since these stacks mainly contain liquidstate bilayers, stacks remain phase separated from the stratum corneum crystalline lipid lamellae. A schematic overview of how such a bilayer stack is illustrated in Fig. 11. Possibly the vesicles £atten in the direction, in which most easily water will be removed from vesicles, which is most probably water di¡usion along the head groups. This speculation might justify the perpendicular orientation of bilayer stacks compared to stratum corneum lamellar stacking. Once skin lipid lamellar stacking is disrupted, bilayer stacks are orientated randomly. However, TEM results did not demonstrate the presence of bilayer stacks after application of both 30 and 70 mol% PEG-8-L:EggPC vesicle formulations. Therefore, further studies are required in order to ¢nd out whether stacking of £attened vesicles is facilitated by the linkage of the C12-chains that might be coupled to hydroxy groups located on opposing sides of L-595 sucrose headgroup. In visualization studies with hairless mouse skin, in vivo, similar lamellar stacks were observed after non-occlusive treatment with PEG-8-L:L-595:CS (70:30:5) vesicles, which were orientated perpendicular to skin lamellae or randomly in areas where the skin lamellar organization was disrupted [33]. Additional studies, using, for example, nanogold-labeled surfactants, should be performed to further elucidate the structure and formation of bilayer stacks. Of course, next to this partitioning of intact vesicles and fusion process in the stratum corneum, it is likely that surfactant molecules are able to diffuse molecularly dispersed through intercellular lipid lamellae and change the lipid organization. 4.2. Freeze-fracture electron microscopy The FFEM results support the TEM results showing major morphological changes in the intercellular lipid lamellar structure after treatment with PEG-8-L containing elastic vesicles. The large lipid fracture are most probably caused by a decrease in resistance within these areas indicating a less cohesive force between adjacent corneocytes, indicating the e¡ect of the PEG-8-L elastic vesicles on intercellular lipids, whereas the ultrastructure of skin treated with L-595 and Wasag-7 vesicles was not a¡ected. Changes in the viable epidermis ultrastructure could not be observed after treatment with any of the vesicle formulations. 4.3. Two-photon excitation microscopy The use of £uorescent labeled vesicles alone to elucidate mechanisms by which vesicles interact with human skin is questionable because only the penetration route of the £uorescent marker or its metabolites can be visualized and not the penetration pathways of vesicles. It is, however, excellent technique to study time pro¢les, penetration pathways and penetration depths of vesicle constituents. As can be seen in Fig. 7, in the absence of vesicles, both acridine orange and £uorescein fail in penetrating into the highly impermeable stratum corneum, as is shown by the presence of a dark 10^20-nm band below the surface. After treatment with £uoresceinDHPE labeled liquid-state vesicles, however, £uorescence is observed within the stratum corneum (Figs. 8 and 9). After an application period of 1 h, the £uorescence extends down into the stratum corneum until the stratum corneum^stratum granulosum interface. Increasing the application period did not show an enhanced penetration depth, which might  most apparent observation after treatment with liquid-state vesicles is thread-like channel formation, which are likely to be located within intercellular spaces, since only in the intercellular regions vesicle constituents have been visualized using electron microscopy. These ¢ne thread-like channels could be mistaken for wrinkles in skin; however, the channels reach all the way down into lower parts of the stratum corneum and could not be observed in the stratum granulosum. In addition, these channels were neither observed in skin stained with £uorescein in the absence of elastic vesicles nor in skin treated with micelles (see Fig. 10) and therefore it can be concluded that these elastic vesicles change the penetration pathway of the dye. TEM micrographs of skin occasionally show wrinkles, but they are signi¢cantly di¡erent since they protrude into the dermis and are considerably larger. Wrinkles such as observed by TEM (see Fig. 2a) are also seen by TPE and appear as bright areas in which £uorescence has accumulated, but have been avoided in the present study when imaging the skin. In other studies, employing confocal laser scanning microscopy, the penetration of amphiphilic £uorescent markers intercalated in vesicle bilayers have been examined as well [6,20]. These studies report of penetration mainly via intercellular routes into the viable epidermis and dermis. In this study, no penetration of £uorescence label into cell layers below the stratum corneum was observed. The studies of van Kuijk-Meuwissen et al. [6] reported a homogeneous distribution of the label in the intercellular space. Cevc et al. [34] proposed the existence of wide clefts between clusters of three to ten corneocytes by which penetration occurs resembling skin wrinkles. However, the appearance of these channels was di¡erent from those observed in this study, in which a ¢ne structure of channels is observed localized in the lipid regions within the surface area of only one cell. The £uorescence of the Wasag-7 rigid vesicles and micelles is restricted to the upper cell layers of the stratum corneum and shows the presence of polygonal shaped corneocytes. No penetration of £uorescent marker was observed below 3^5 Wm into the stratum corneum. 5. Conclusions Elastic vesicles primarily a¡ected intercellular skin lamellae of the stratum corneum. Cell layers below the stratum corneum remained una¡ected as was shown by electron microscopy and further supported by the TPE results. Thread-like penetration pathways were visualized by TPE, which were restricted to the stratum corneum and dependent on dehydration of the elastic vesicle formulations rather than application period. The thread-like channels are most likely to be located within intercellular spaces as was shown by TEM and FFEM, which showed modulations of intercellular lipid lamellae. To gain even more insight in the exact mechanisms by which elastic liquid-state vesicles induce ultrastructural changes, other studies, using for example gold labeling techniques could be performed. Finally, for the topical application of membrane associated drugs, elastic liquid-state vesicles may create or modify penetration pathways in the stratum corneum through which drug molecules can di¡use. Drug molecules could be incorporated in either vesicle bilayers or, in case, the drug molecule change the elasticity and stability of the vesicles, elastic vesicle formulations could be applied prior to application of the drug to induce a penetration enhancement e¡ect.

21	2001	Targeted delivery and triggered release of liposomal doxorubicin enhances cytotoxicity against human B lymphoma cells	Abstract Dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE)-containing liposomes that demonstrated pH-dependent release of their contents were stabilized in the bilayer form through the addition of a cleavable lipid derivative of polyethylene glycol (PEG) in which the PEG was attached to a lipid anchor via a disulfide linkage (mPEG-S-S-DSPE). Liposomes stabilized with either a non-cleavable PEG (mPEG-DSPE) or mPEG-S-S-DSPE retained an encapsulated dye at pH 5.5, but treatment at pH 5.5 of liposomes stabilized with mPEG-S-S-DSPE with either dithiothreitol or cell-free extracts caused contents release due to cleavage of the PEG chains and concomitant destabilization of the DOPE liposomes. While formulations loaded with doxorubicin (DXR) were stable in culture media, DXR was rapidly released in human plasma. pH-Sensitive liposomes, targeted to the CD19 epitope on B-lymphoma cells, showed enhanced DXR delivery into the nuclei of the target cells and increased cytotoxicity compared to non-pH-sensitive liposomes. Pharmacokinetic studies suggested that mPEG-S-S-DSPE was rapidly cleaved in circulation. In a murine model of B-cell lymphoma, the therapeutic efficacy of an anti-CD19-targeted pH-sensitive formulation was superior to that of a stable long-circulating formulation of targeted liposomes despite the more rapid drug release and clearance of the pH-sensitive formulation. These results suggest that targeted pH-sensitive formulations of drugs may be able to increase the therapeutic efficacy of entrapped drugs. 1. Introduction Long-circulating liposomal doxorubicin (DXR), Caelyx/Doxil, is currently approved for clinical use in the treatment of refractory Kaposi's sarcoma and ovarian cancer [1^3]. However, the passive targeting approach that has made liposomal drugs successful in the treatment of solid tumors will be less successful when applied to haematological malignancies. To increase the uptake of liposomal drugs by malignant B cells, a ligand-mediated targeting approach has been employed [4]. Many investigators have evaluated long-circulating targeted liposomes (stericallystabilized immunoliposomes, SIL), which have antibodies, their fragments or other ligands attached to the PEG termini, for their ability to increase the selective delivery of liposomal contents to target tissues and cells in vivo and in vitro [4^14]. We have reported that anti-CD19-targeted sterically-stabilized liposomes (SIL[anti-CD19]) bound selectively to CD19 human B-lymphoma cells, triggering endocytosis of the liposomes [15]. The encapsulated DXR accumulated in the endosomes of the target cells and was released from the endosomes into the cytoplasm only very slowly. This has led us to hypothesize that a more rapid rate of release of the drug from the endosomes would lead to more rapid delivery of the drug to its intracellular site of action, resulting in improved therapeutic e¤cacy for the targeted liposomal drugs. The lipid dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE) adopts a nonbilayer (hexagonal, HII) structure in an aqueous medium at neutral pH [16^18] but, when combined with stabilizing components such as cholesteryl hemisuccinate (CHEMS) [16], the lipids can assemble into a bilayer. These liposomes are postulated to destabilize in the acidic environment of the endosomes, rapidly releasing their contents [16,19,20]. Current formulations of pH-sensitive liposomes are unstable in blood and are rapidly cleared from the circulation by the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) [21,22]. One way to increase their circulation half-life is to include lipid derivatives of PEG in the liposome formulations, but this leads to a decrease in the pH-dependant release of dye from these liposomes [23,24]. A PEG-lipid derivative with a disul¢de linkage (mPEG-S-S-DSPE) has been synthesized by Zalipsky [25]. Thiolytic cleavage of the grafted PEG from the surface of pH-sensitive formulations restored pH sensitivity, leading to release of the liposomal contents [25,26]. This linker is hypothesized to resist cleavage in the circulation. Targeting ligands bound to these liposomes may allow the liposomes to circulate long enough to bind to, and be internalized by, the target cells. Subsequently, cleavage of the disul¢de linkage by lysosomal enzymes within the target cells should lead to a restoration of the pH sensitivity and allow rapid content release and increased cytotoxicity. Here we report the development of anti-CD19-targeted, DXR-loaded, pH-sensitive liposomes stabilized with PEG-lipid derivatives, which can be expected to selectively deliver their contents to target cells with rapid intracellular drug release. Comparisons are made of liposomes containing either cleavable PEG (mPEG-S-S-DSPE) or non-cleavable PEG (mPEG-DSPE) as stabilizing components. The liposomes are characterized in vitro as to drug release properties and cytotoxicity against a CD19 human B-lymphoma cell line (Namalwa). In addition, we test the therapeutic e¤cacy of the formulations in vivo in SCID mice implanted with the Namalwa cell line. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Materials Hydrogenated soy phosphatidylcholine (HSPC), mPEG2000-distearoylphosphatidyl-ethanolamine (mPEG2000-DSPE, also abbreviated mPEG-DSPE) and doxorubicin (DXR) were generous gifts from Alza Corp. (Mountain View, CA). Maleimide-derivatized PEG2000-DSPE (Mal-PEG-DSPE) [27] was custom synthesized by Shearwater Polymers (Huntsville, AL). Cholesterol (CHOL) and dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). N-[2-g-methoxypoly(ethylene glycol)-K aminocarbonyl-ethyl-dithiopropionyl]-DSPE (mPEG-S-S-DSPE, disul¢de-linker) was synthesized as described elsewhere [25]. Sephadex G-50 and Sepharose CL-4B were purchased from Pharmacia Biotech (Uppsala, Sweden). Na125I and cholesteryl-[1,2-[3H](N)]-hexadecyl ether ([3H]CHE) were purchased from Mandel Scienti¢c (Guelph, ON). Cholesteryl hemisuccinate (CHEMS), 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-ly)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and iminothiolane were purchased from Sigma Chemicals (Oakville, ON). p-Xylenebis-pyridinium bromide (DPX) and trisodium 8-hydroxypyrenetrisulfonate (HPTS) were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Iodination of IgG was performed according to the method described elsewhere [4]. Tyraminylinulin (TI) synthesis and preparation of [125I]TI have been described previously [28]. The murine monoclonal antibody (mAb) anti-CD19 was prepared from the FMC-63 murine anti-CD19 hybridoma cell line obtained from Dr. H. Zola (Children's Health Research Institute, Australia). The human B-lymphoma cell line Namalwa (ATCC CRL 1432) was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (MD, USA). Human plasma was obtained from healthy volunteers at the University of Alberta, Department of Pharmacology. Nuclepore polycarbonate membranes (0.08, 0.1 and 0.2 Wm pore size) were purchased from Northern Lipids (Vancouver, BC). All other chemicals were of analytical grade. 2.2. Preparation of liposomes Sterically stabilized pH-sensitive liposomes were prepared from a mixture of DOPE or DOPE/ CHEMS (6:4 molar ratio) and either mPEG-DSPE or mPEG-S-S-DSPE. The lipid molar ratios of the di¡erent formulations are indicated in the text or in Table or Figure legends. SIL (not pH-sensitive) for coupling to anti-CD19 were composed of HSPC/ CHOL/mPEG-DSPE/Mal-PEG-DSPE, 2:1:0.08:0.02. Brie£y, chloroform solutions of lipids were mixed and the solvent was evaporated using a rotary evaporator; residual solvent was removed under high vacuum. The dried lipid ¢lms were hydrated with an appropriate bu¡er and sequentially extruded through a series of polycarbonate ¢lters with pore sizes ranging from 0.2 to 0.08 Wm, using a Lipex Extruder (Lipex Biomembranes, Vancouver, BC). The mean diameter of liposomes was determined by dynamic light scattering using a Brookhaven BI-90 Particle Sizer (Brookhaven Instruments, Holtsville, NY). The diameters of extruded liposomes were in the range of 120 þ 10 nm. For liposomes loaded with either HPTS-DPX or [125I]TI, the lipid ¢lms were hydrated with HPTS-DPX solution (30 mM HPTS, 30 mM DPX, pH 9.0, adjusted to 290 mosmol with NaCl) or [125I]TI solution (pH 9.0). Following extrusion, the untrapped dye or [125I]TI was removed by chromatography on Sephadex G50 or Sepharose CL-4B columns, respectively, eluted with HEPES bu¡er (25 mM HEPES, 140 mM NaCl), pH 7.4. DXR-SIL[anti-CD19] were prepared and DXR loaded by the ammonium sulfate loading method at 65³C as previously described [4]. The lipid molar ratios of the additional targeted formulations of liposomal DXR, composed of DXR-DOPE/mPEGDSPE[anti-CD19], DXR-DOPE/CHEMS/mPEGDSPE[anti-CD19], DXR-DOPE/mPEG-S-S-DSPE- [anti-CD19], or DXR-DOPE/CHEMS/mPEG-S-SDSPE[anti-CD19] are indicated in the text or in Table or Figure legends; the drug was encapsulated by remote loading using an ammonium sulfate gradient [29] with minor modi¢cations. Brie£y, the lipid ¢lms were hydrated in 250 mM ammonium sulfate at pH 8.5 for formulations containing DOPE/CHEMS/ PEG-DSPE or at pH 9.0 for formulations containing DOPE/PEG-DSPE, with addition of minute amounts of NaOH until complete hydration was obtained. Following extrusion, the external bu¡er was exchanged by eluting through a Sephadex G-50 column equilibrated with 10% sucrose, 25 mM Trizma base at pH 8.5 or pH 9.0, as appropriate. The higher pH was necessary to get DOPE formulations to self-assemble into bilayers [16,30]. DXR was added to the liposomes at a DXR/PL ratio of 0.2:1 (w/w), and the liposomes were incubated for 15 min at 22³C. The liposome-encapsulated DXR was separated from free DXR by chromatography on a Sephadex G-50 column eluted with degassed HEPES bu¡er. Coupling of anti-CD19 mAb to Mal-PEG-DSPE on the liposomes was carried out according to a previously described method [15], using 125I-labeled anti-CD19 mAb as a tracer. The concentration of liposome-entrapped DXR was determined by spectrophotometry (V= 490 nm) following methanol extraction. Phospholipid concentrations were determined using the Fiske^Subbarow colorimetric assay [31]. All mAb densities were routinely in the range of 30^60 Wg anti-CD19/Wmol PL for in vivo experiments and 65^80 Wg anti-CD19/Wmol PL for in vitro experiments. BBAMEM 78170 9-11-01 146 T. Ishida et al. / Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1515 (2001) 144^158 2.3. In vitro leakage experiments Liposomes containing either entrapped HPTSDPX or DXR were passed over a Sephadex G-50 column immediately prior to use to remove any residual free dye or drug. The release of entrapped solute was studied using a £uorescence-dequenching assay. Fifty Wl of liposomes containing entrapped dye (HPTS-DPX) or DXR were incubated at 0.5 mM ¢nal PL concentration at 37³C in 450 Wl of various pH bu¡ers, cell-free extract (CFE), human plasma, or cell-culture medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). At various time points, the percentage of released HPTS was determined in an aliquot of the incubation mixture by the increase in sample £uorescence at an emission wavelength of 512 nm and an excitation wavelength of 413 nm [32] relative to that of the pre-incubation sample (zero release) using an SLM-Aminco Model 8100 £uorimeter (Spectronic Instruments, Rochester, NY); values were normalized to the increase in £uorescence obtained after lysis of a pre-incubation sample with 10% Triton X-100 [25]. The £uorescence of DXR contained in liposomes was quenched due to its self-association when loaded by the ammonium sulfate method; DXR leakage was determined by £uorescence dequenching at excitation and emission wavelengths of 485 and 590 nm, respectively. Liposomes were incubated at 37³C with various bu¡ers, CFE, cell-culture medium containing 10% FBS, or human plasma. At designated intervals, aliquots were taken, and the amount of released DXR was determined as described above. Total DXR (100% dequenched) was measured by lysing the liposomes at a ¢nal Triton X-100 concentration of 0.5% (v/v). 2.4. Preparation of cell-free extracts Namalwa cells were maintained in logarithmic growth conditions in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS at 37³C in a humidi¢ed atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Cells (1.0U108) were collected by centrifugation (1000 rpm for 10 min) and washed with 20 ml of TEA bu¡er (10 mM triethanolamine, 0.25 M sucrose, 10 mM acetic acid, and 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.4). The washed cells were resuspended in 4 ml TEA bu¡er and a protease inhibitor cocktail formulated for mammalian cell extracts (4-(2-aminoe ethyl)-benzenesulfonyl £uoride, pepstatin A, transepoxysuccinyl-L-leucylamino(4-guanidino)butane, bestatin, leupeptin, and aprotinin; Sigma, MO, USA) was added at 100 Wl per gram of cells. The cells were ruptured at 4³C using 40 ¢rm strokes with a tight-¢tting Dounce homogenizer. Unbroken cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 10 min at 4³C. The CFE was carefully removed from the cell pellet and then diluted to 6 ml with the addition of TEA bu¡er. 2.5. Nuclear accumulation assay Nuclear accumulation of DXR was determined according to the method of Kirchmeier et al. [33]. Brie£y, 4.5U108/500 ml Namalwa cells, maintained under logarithmic growth conditions in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS, were treated with various DXR formulations at a DXR concentration of 8 WM. At various time points (0, 2, 4, 8, 12 h), 100 ml of cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 10 min and washed with 20 ml of TEA bu¡er. Washed cells were resuspended in 3 ml TEA bu¡er and ruptured at 4³C using 40 ¢rm strokes with a tight-¢tting Dounce homogenizer. Unbroken cells were pelleted and the CFE, which contained the nuclei, was carefully removed from the cell pellet. To obtain more complete homogenization, the pellet of unbroken cells was suspended in TEA bu¡er (3 ml) and ruptured a second time, followed again by removal of the unbroken cells. The combined supernatants were centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 10 min to remove any remaining unbroken cells. The supernatant from this centrifugation step was spun at 2000 rpm for 2.5 min at 4³C to pellet nuclei. After removal of the supernatant, the pellet was diluted to 1 ml with TEA bu¡er, then vortexed and sonicated until the nuclei were evenly dispersed, as determined by visual inspection. For each time point, three aliquots of the nuclear fractions (0.2 ml each) were placed in 1.3 ml TEA. DNA was enzymatically digested by the addition of 10 Wl digitonin solution (25 mg/ml in sterile PBS, Sigma, St. Louis, MO), 10 Wl MgCl2 solution (57 mg/ml in sterile PBS) and 50 Wl DNase 1 solution (3 mg/ml in sterile PBS, Sigma). Following digestion at 22³C for 2 h, the DXR £uorescence was recorded (excitation at 480 nm and emission at 595 nm). The BBAMEM 78170 9-11-01 T. Ishida et al. / Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1515 (2001) 144^158 147 purity of the nuclear fraction was checked by determining the levels of enzyme markers for various cellular organelles [15]. 2.6. In vitro cytotoxicity experiments A comparison of the in vitro cytotoxicity of free DXR and various liposomal formulations was performed on Namalwa cells with an in vitro proliferation assay using a tetrazolium dye (MTT) [34], as described in [4]. 2.7. Blood elimination of liposomes in BALB/c (inbred) mice Female BALB/c Cr Alt B/M mice, in the weight range of 17^22 g, were obtained from University of Alberta Health Sciences Laboratory Animal Services, and were injected via the tail vein with a single bolus dose of 0.2 ml of liposomes of various formulations containing encapsulated [125I]TI (0.5 Wmol PL/ mouse). At selected times post-injection, mice were anesthetized with halothane and sacri¢ced by cervical dislocation. A blood sample (100 Wl) was collected by cardiac puncture. Blood samples, various organs and the carcass were counted for 125I label in a Beckman 8000 gamma counter. Data were analyzed using PKAnalyst (MicroMath Scienti¢c Software). 2.8. In vivo therapeutic experiments Namalwa cells were passaged i.p. in CB.-17/ICR Tac SCID mice (Charles River Laboratories, Quebec, Canada) to develop a more virulent strain with reproducible tumor take [4]. Namalwa cells were harvested in sterile PBS and implanted into SCID mice. Cell viability was assessed by dye exclusion using Trypan Blue dye before and after the implantation process. For therapeutic experiments, CB-17/ICR Tac SCID mice (Charles River Laboratories), 6^8 weeks of age, were injected with cells i.v. (5U106) and treated i.v. at 24 h after implantation with a single dose of 3 mg DXR/kg as either free DXR, DXR-SIL[anti-CD19] or targeted DXR-loaded DOPE/CHEMS formulations stabilized with either mPEG-DSPE or mPEG-S-S-DSPE. Mice were monitored routinely for weight loss, and euthanized as they became moribund; survival times were recorded. All animal experiments  corded. All animal experiments were approved by the Health Sciences Animal Policy and Welfare Committee of the University of Alberta (Edmonton, Alberta, Canada). 2.9. Statistics Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Instat software (v.3.01, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) using analysis of variance for multiple comparisons. Data were considered signi¢cant at P 6 0.05. 3. Results 3.1. pH sensitivity of liposomal HPTS in bu¡er Leakage of HPTS from DOPE (Fig. 1) and DOPE/CHEMS (Fig. 2) liposomes, stabilized with mPEG-DSPE (Fig. 1A and 2A) or mPEG-S-SDSPE (Fig. 1B and 2B), was examined as a function of pH and reducing conditions. At physiological pH and ionic strength, DOPE does not form bilayers, but rather exists in an inverted hexagonal (HII) phase [17]. However, DOPE will form liposomes readily at higher pH, upon deprotonation of the amine group. Dilution of DOPE liposomes, made at pH 8.5^9.0, into pH 7.4 or pH 5.5 bu¡ers led to rapid release of contents (Fig. 1A). Incorporation of 5 mol% mPEGDSPE (Fig. 1A) or mPEG-S-S-DSPE (Fig. 1B) into DOPE liposomes resulted in the formation of liposomes which did not leak at physiological or acid pH over 24 h. Treatment of liposomes with dithiothreitol (DTT) was used to induce thiolytic cleavage of mPEG-S-S-DSPE from the lipid membrane anchor (DSPE) in liposomes containing mPEG-S-S-DSPE (Fig. 1B). DOPE liposomes containing 5 mol% mPEG-S-S-DSPE had little contents release over 24 h in the presence of DTT at pH 7.4 (Fig. 1B); however at pH 5.5, treatment with DTT led to a gradual release of HPTS (50% release in about 10 h). At pH 5.5, a DOPE formulation that contained 3 mol% mPEG-S-S-DSPE had a much more rapid release of contents (100% release in 2 h, data not shown). DOPE liposomes can also be stabilized in the bilayer state by an amphiphile with bulky and/or charge-repulsing hydrophilic moieties [35]. CHEMS  mating the lysosomal pH of between 5 and 6.5 [37,38]. DOPE formulations, or DOPE formulations with 3 mol% mPEG-S-S-DSPE, released their contents in CFE with half-lives of 1.7 h (Fig. 3A). The release rate in CFE of the DOPE formulation with 5 mol% mPEG-S-S-DSPE was considerably slower; only 40% of encapsulated dye was released over 24 h (Fig. 3A). All three DOPE/CHEMS formulations, with or without mPEG-S-S-DSPE, released HPTS rapidly in CFE at pH 5.5; this release was almost complete by 8 h (Fig. 3B). DOPE/CHEMS and DOPE/CHEMS/mPEG-S-S-DSPE formulations incubated in CFE adjusted to pH 7.4 released HPTS at much slower rates (data not shown). 3.3. Leakage of HPTS or DXR from pH-sensitive liposomes incubated in human plasma Having evaluated the leakage rates of the hydrophilic compound HPTS from various liposome formulations in bu¡er or CFE, we proceeded to evaluate leakage in 90% human plasma at 37³C. The chemical structure of the loaded drug will have an e¡ect on the rate of its leakage from a liposome formulation. HPTS is passively loaded into liposomes as the water-soluble (but £uorescencequenched) complex, HPTS-DPX. When HPTSDPX leaks from liposomes, it dissociates into free HPTS and DPX, increasing the HPTS £uorescence when excited at 413 nm. Less than 20% of encapsulated HPTS leaked from DOPE/mPEG-DSPE, DOPE/CHEMS/mPEG-DSPE, DOPE/mPEG-S-SDSPE or DOPE/CHEMS/mPEG-S-S-DSPE formulations over 24 h in human plasma (not shown). Doxorubicin is normally actively loaded into liposomes at a pH of about 5.5, using an ammonium sulfate gradient, resulting in the precipitation of a (DXR-NH3)2SO4 gel inside the liposomes [29]. However, at the higher pH required to assemble DOPE/ CHEMS/PEG-DSPE into liposomes, it is not known whether DXR forms a precipitate inside liposomes during active loading, and this may a¡ect the rate at which DXR leaks from these pH-sensitive liposomes. The leakage of DXR in human plasma was examined for anti-CD19-targeted liposomes of DOPE/mPEG-DSPE, DOPE/CHEMS/mPEG-DSPE (Fig. 4A), DOPE/mPEG-S-S-DSPE or DOPE/ CHEMS/mPEG-S-S-DSPE (Fig. 4B) liposomes. There was rapid leakage of DXR from all formulations with the exception of DOPE/CHEMS/mPEGDSPE, which had a somewhat slower (but still rapid) leakage rate (Fig. 4A). There was no signi¢cant difference in the rate of DXR release between the antiCD19-targeted and similar non-targeted formulations (containing 5 mol % mPEG) in the presence of human plasma (data not shown). Before using these liposomes in cell-culture experiments, we also examined whether anti-CD19-targeted DXR-loaded formulations of the same lipid compositions described in the previous paragraph were sta IC50s than the DXR-SL or DXR-SIL[anti-CD19] formulations (P 6 0.001). Possibly this is because the overall release rates of DXR from the DOPE or DOPE/CHEMS formulations (Figs. 1^4) are higher than the release rates of DXR from DXR-SL or DXR-SIL[anti-CD19], which have a negligible release of drug on the time scale of our experiments [4]. Targeted DOPE and DOPE/CHEMS formulations had IC50s that were comparable in most instances to those for free DXR (Table 1). The IC50s of DXR-loaded targeted formulations of either DOPE or DOPE/CHEMS (stabilized with mPEG-DSPE or mPEG-S-S-DSPE) were signi¢cantly lower than the IC50s of the non-targeted formulations (P 6 0.05 to P 6 0.001). Notably, there was a trend for formulations that contained mPEG-DSPE to be slightly more cytotoxic than those that contained mPEG-SS-DSPE, whether targeted or non-targeted. Targeted formulations without encapsulated DXR were not toxic at concentrations below 0.06 WM DOPE, which would correspond to a DXR concentration of 34.5 WM, if the formulations contained DXR (not shown). 3.5. Nuclear accumulation of doxorubicin within Namalwa cells In theory, the rate of release of encapsulated DXR from the lysosomal apparatus, following internalization of targeted liposomes, is a determining factor in the cytotoxicity of liposome-encapsulated DXR. To  liposome preparations, liposomes containing radiolabeled [125I]TI were prepared and injected into the tail vein of mice at a PL dose of 0.5 Wmol/mouse. Circulation times increased with increasing concentration of mPEG-DSPE in either DOPE or DOPE/CHEMS liposome formulations (Fig. 6A,B). Approximately 5^10% of the injected liposomes still remained in the blood 24 h after injection of liposomes containing 10 mol% mPEG-DSPE. Injection of DOPE or DOPE/CHEMS liposomes that were not stabilized with mPEG-DSPE resulted in rapid clearance of the liposomes. Liposomes accumulated primarily in the liver and spleen (not shown). Inclusion of from 2 to 9 mol% of mPEG-S-S-DSPE did not increase the circulation times for either the DOPE (Fig. 6C) or DOPE/CHEMS (Fig. 6D) formulations. All mPEGS-S-DSPE formulations contained 1 mol% mPEGDSPE to mimic the e¡ect of adding 1 mol% coupling lipid to the formulations in targeting experiments. Increasing amounts of mPEG-S-S-DSPE in the formulations did not increase circulation half-lives of the formulations to any signi¢cant extent (Fig. 6A,B), likely because the mPEG-S-S-DSPE was rapidly cleaved in plasma. 3.7. In vivo therapeutic experiments For therapeutic experiments, SCID mice (5 mice/ group), implanted i.v. with 5U106 Namalwa cells, were treated i.v. at 24 h after implantation with single doses of 3 mg/kg free DXR or liposome-encapsulated DXR (Table 2). No evidence of drug toxicity was observed in any experimental group. None of the non-targeted DXR-loaded formulations showed improved therapeutic e¤cacy over the control group (P s 0.05). All groups treated with targeted formulations had signi¢cantly higher increased life spans (%ILS) than did the control group or groups treated with non-targeted formulations (P 6 0.001). The group treated with DXR-DOPE/CHEMS/mPEG-SS-DSPE/Mal-PEG-DSPE[anti-CD19] had a signi¢- cantly increased %ILS compared to the other targeted treatment groups (vs. DXR-DOPE/CHEMS/ mPEG-DSPE/Mal-PEG-DSPE[anti-CD19], P 6 0.001; vs. DXR-SIL[anti-CD19], P 6 0.01). 4. Discussion Ligand-mediated targeting of drug carrier systems like SIL can improve site-speci¢c drug delivery [4^ 14]. We have previously demonstrated that the targeting of DXR-SIL[anti-CD19] to CD19, an internalizing epitope expressed on cells of B-cell lineage, increases its therapeutic index against B-cell-derived haematological malignancies [4,39]. In this study we have attempted to further increase the e¤cacy of anti-CD19-targeted liposomal formulations of DXR by increasing the rate of intracellular drug release through the strategy of employing pH-sensitive tarTable 2 In vivo survival studies with triggered release formulations in SCID mice bearing CD19 human B-lymphoma (Namalwa) cells Treatment MST þ S.D.(days) % ILS Saline 21.0 þ 1.6 ^ Free DXR 23.0 þ 1.4 9.5 DOPE/CHEMS/mPEG-DSPE 27.8 þ 1.6 32.4 DOPE/CHEMS/mPEG-S-S-DSPE 25.8 þ 4.0 22.9 HSPC/CHOL/mPEG-DSPE 24.2 þ 1.3 15.2 DOPE/CHEMS/mPEG-DSPE[anti-CD19] 42.2 þ 4.1 101 DOPE/CHEMS/mPEG-S-S-DSPE[anti-CD19] 53.8 þ 6.5 156.2 HSPC/CHOL/mPEG-DSPE[anti-CD19] 43.2 þ 5.7 105.7 SCID mice were implanted i.v. with 5U106 cells, then injected i.v. 24 h later with either saline, free DXR, or DXR-loaded in either anti-CD19 targeted or non-targeted, mPEG-DSPE-stabilized or mPEG-S-S-DSPE-stabilized formulations composed of HSPC/CHOL/ mPEG-DSPE/Mal-PEG-DSPE (2:1:0.08:0.02) or DOPE/CHEMS/mPEG-DSPE/Mal-PEG-DSPE (6:4:0.24:0.06) or DOPE/CHEMS/ mPEG-S-S-DSPE/Mal-PEG-DSPE (6:4:0.24:0.06).

Liposomes exhibiting pH sensitivity have been described previously, but their potential for use in vivo has been hampered by their rapid removal from circulation into the MPS. Although inclusion of mPEG-DSPE into pH-sensitive, DOPE-containing liposome formulations increased both the stability and the circulation half-lives of the liposomes, these liposomes did not destabilize at low pH, as determined by an in vitro dye release assay [23^25]. Theoretically, this loss of pH sensitivity could be avoided through the incorporation of cleavable PEG-lipid derivatives into the formulations. As previously reported, addition of 3 mol% of a thiol cleavable PEG-derivative, mPEG-S-SDSPE, signi¢cantly increased the stability of DOPE or DOPE/CHEMS formulations in vitro; the pH-dependent leakage of HPTS was restored by treatment with a thiolytic agent, DTT, which cleaves the PEG chains from mPEG-S-S-DSPE [25]. At physiological pH, DOPE is in the HII state and is incapable of entrapping contents (since there is no aqueous interior space). Bilayer liposomes of DOPE can be made at pHs above the pKa for the amine group, i.e., above a pH of approximately 8.5, and these structures will retain contents within their aqueous interior [17]. DOPE can also be stabilized in the bilayer state in the presence of CHEMS at pHs where the acid is negatively charged, i.e., above a pH of approximately 6.0 [36]. These considerations explain the results we presented in Figs. 1 and 2 for release of HPTS from DOPE or DOPE/CHEMS liposomes in the absence of PEG-lipid. It can also be seen from Figs. 1 and 2 that inclusion of a small mol% of a molecule having a bulky headgroup, e.g., a PEG-lipid derivative, can stabilize DOPE or DOPE/CHEMS in the bilayer state in the pH range of 5.5^7.4. When a disul¢de-containing lipopolymer, mPEG-S-S-DSPE, is included in the lipid bilayer, thiolytic cleavage of the PEG headgroup with DTT leaves a bilayer that is inherently unstable, being composed of only DOPE or DOPE/CHEMS and a small amount of DSPE. As can be seen in Fig. 1B and 2B, liposomes containing mPEG-S-S-DSPE have an increased rate of contents release at pH 5.5, although contents release is less rapid than that seen for similar liposomes that never contained PEG (Fig. 1A and 2A). A slow rate of cleavage of mPEG-S-S-DSPE, or incomplete cleavage of mPEGS-S-DSPE likely contributes to the slower release rate. Cellular enzymes extracted from cells are capable of mimicking the action of DTT in cleaving mPEG-S-S-DSPE (Fig. 3). DXR, but not HPTS, was rapidly released from liposomes in 90% human plasma (Fig. 4). This might be due to the mechanism used for DXR loading. DXR is a weak base: the charged form of the drug is favored at acid pH, and the neutral form of the drug (which is membrane permeable) is favored at basic pH. In the loading method we used for DXR, the interior of the liposomes contains ammonium sulfate. The drug in the neutral form crosses the liposomal membrane from exterior to interior where it is protonated, leading to the formation of an insoluble DXR-sulfate precipitate [29]. These preparations are very stable, with extremely slow rates of drug release. However, DOPE will not hydrate to form bilayer liposomes at acid pH, so we prepared DOPE and DOPE/CHEMS liposomes in a pH 8.5^9.0 ammonium sulfate solution. Although the loading e¤ciency at this pH is greater than 95%, the neutral form of DXR is favored at pH 8.5, and hence it may not be able to form a stable precipitate with ammonium sulfate. We have tried forming and hydrating the pH-sensitive liposomes at basic pH ( s pH 9.0) in the presence of mPEGS-S-DSPE, then lowering the pH prior to drug loading. Although the DOPE will stay in the bilayer state when the pH is lowered, we have not yet been successful in achieving pH-sensitive formulations of DXR that do not have fairly high rates of drug release in human plasma. Future experiments may need to be done with other antineoplastic drugs that are more amenable to stable loading into these DXR-containing pH-sensitive formulations. To demonstrate the kinetics of release of DXR from the lysosomal apparatus, the rate of accumulation of DXR in cellular nuclei was measured as a function of time by using a DXR nuclear accumulation assay (Fig. 5). As expected, little nuclear uptake of DXR was seen for DXR-SL, since it has a very slow rate of drug release [40] and the only mechanism for the drug to reach the nucleus is through passive di¡usion into the cell of drug released from the liposomes into the culture medium. When these liposomes are targeted with anti-CD19 (DXR-SIL[anti-CD19]), nuclear levels of DXR in Namalwa BBAMEM 78170 9-11-01 T. Ishida et al. / Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1515 (2001) 144^158 155 cells increased approximately 3-fold, most likely because the liposome drug packages were taken up into the cell by receptor-mediated internalization. However, the intracellular rate of drug release from endosomes is slow [15], hence the comparatively low levels of nuclear DXR. The more rapid rates of drug release for the non-targeted pH-sensitive formulations (at all pHs) compared with the DXR-SIL[anti-CD19] and DXR-SL formulations led to more drug release into the media and hence more drug delivery to the nucleus via a passive di¡usion mechanism. It is possible, but not con¢rmed, that the DOPE and DOPE/ CHEMS formulations may also deliver some drug into the cell cytoplasm by a fusion mechanism, and from there it would be available to tra¤c to the cell nucleus. As might be predicted from their in vitro drug release rates and their ability to trigger receptor-mediated endocytosis, the targeted mPEG-S-SDSPE formulations have the highest rates and levels of nuclear accumulation among the liposomal formulations. In Table 1, the cytotoxicity (IC50) values for these formulations parallel the nuclear accumulation data, supporting the hypothesis that not only the total amount of uptake of liposomal drug, but also the rate of release of the encapsulated drug governs the cytotoxicities of liposomal drugs. Total cellular uptake of liposomal drug can be increased via the mechanism of receptor-mediated internalization, and intracellular drug release can be increased through mechanisms such as the pH-sensitive triggered-release mechanism, described here. One anomaly is the observation that liposomes containing mPEG-S-S-DSPE have higher nuclear accumulations (Fig. 5), and faster rates of drug release in CFE or bu¡er, but do not have higher cytotoxicity than mPEG-containing liposomes (Table 1). These results might be explained in light of the recent observations of Goren et al. in experiments where the cytotoxicity of folate-targeted liposomal DXR was examined in MDR cells that overexpress the folate receptor [14]. In spite of up to 6-fold higher accumulation of DXR in the cell nucleus, when it was delivered in targeted liposomes relative to free drug, they were unable to reverse multidrug resistance in their cells. The authors interpret these results to mean that a long period of time is necessary to allow for the disaggregation of DXR (dissolution of the insoluble DXR-SO4 and solubilization of DXR dimers) following the internalization of liposomes and their degradation within the cell interior. The 48 h incubation time that we used in our cytotoxicity experiments after washing away the drugs may not have been long enough to allow for su¤cient disaggregation of the DXR to see a di¡erence between the liposomes containing mPEG-S-S-DSPE versus mPEG-DSPE. Previous studies have shown that inclusion of mPEG-DSPE increases the circulation half-life of DOPE and DOPE/CHEMS formulations [24]. However, the inclusion of mPEG-S-S-DSPE did not increase the circulation time of the DOPE and DOPE/ CHEMS formulations (Fig. 6). Since 10 mol% of mPEG-DSPE in either DOPE or DOPE/CHEMS liposomes gave signi¢cantly longer circulation halflives than 9 mol% mPEG-S-S-DSPE plus 1 mol% mPEG-DSPE (Fig. 6), we believe that the short half-life of liposomes containing mPEG-S-S-DSPE is probably due to rapid cleavage of the disul¢de linkage by blood components, e.g. cysteine, in vivo. The loss of steric hindrance due to the loss of PEG from the liposomes would decrease their stability in blood and increase the uptake of liposomes by the MPS. We have previously shown that DXR-SIL[antiCD19] binds to, and is internalized by, human Blymphoma (Namalwa) cells within a few minutes [4,15]. If this process occurs rapidly enough in vivo, then we may still be able to achieve good therapeutic results with targeted, mPEG-S-S-DSPE-stabilized, pH-sensitive formulations even though these formulations release the encapsulated DXR rapidly and have short circulation half-lives in vivo. To test this hypothesis, we conducted therapeutic studies with these formulations in SCID mice inoculated with CD19 Namalwa cells. In spite of their rapid leakage and clearance, it appears that the therapeutic e¤cacy of anti-CD19-targeted, mPEG-DSPE-stabilized DOPE/CHEMS liposomes was similar to that of DXR-SIL[anti-CD19] liposomes, and the e¤cacy of mPEG-S-S-DSPE-stabilized DOPE/CHEMS formulations was moderately higher (Table 2). The longer time of exposure of the liposomal drugs to the cells in vivo may have allowed more time for drug disaggregation, supporting the studies of Goren et al. [14]. These results strongly suggest that if retention of encapsulated drug and stability in blood circulation BBAMEM 78170 9-11-01 156 T. Ishida et al. / Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1515 (2001) 144^158 could be further improved, then triggered release formulations targeted against internalizing epitopes will be able to substantially increase the therapeutic index of encapsulated drug in vivo. Development of a formulation that has both good drug retention properties in the presence of human plasma and prolonged circulation time is in progress in our laboratories. In this study, we developed targeted, pH-sensitive liposomes sterically stabilized by PEG, which was surface-grafted via a chemically-cleavable bond (mPEG-S-S-DSPE). These targeted, pH-sensitive formulations stabilized with mPEG-S-S-DSPE (triggered-release formulations) delivered encapsulated DXR e¤ciently into the cytoplasm of target cells and improved the cytotoxicity of encapsulated DXR in vitro, relative to a targeted formulation that lacked triggered release properties, i.e., DXRSIL[anti-CD19]. The targeted triggered release formulations resulted in a modest increase in therapeutic e¤cacy in vivo. The usefulness of this approach has been demonstrated in this study. Further optimization of these formulations may result in additional increases in their therapeutic e¤cacy in vivo. In addition, the unique properties of these targeted, triggered-release formulations may be used for the intracytoplasmic delivery of plasmids, antisense oligonucleotides, and ribozymes in vivo for the treatment of cancer and viral infections.

22	2005	Type I Interferons Potently Suppress Gene Expression Following Gene Delivery Using Liposome–DNA Complexes	Gene delivery by intravenous injection of cationic liposome-DNA complexes (LDC) can generate efficient transgene expression in the lungs and other organs, but the duration of expression is typically short. Previous studies have suggested a major role for interferon-; (IFN-;) and TNF in this process. However, plasmid DNA is also capable of eliciting production of type I IFNs. Therefore, we assessed the ability of LDC to elicit production of type I IFNs in vivo and assessed the effects of type I IFNs on suppression of transgene expression following in vivo gene delivery with LDC. Injection of LDC was found to induce production of high levels of both IFN-A and IFN-B in vivo. Moreover, the levels of transgene expression following in vivo gene delivery were markedly increased in mice lacking functional type I IFN receptor genes, compared to wild-type mice or mice lacking IFN-; or TNF receptors. Addition of recombinant IFN-A and IFN-B inhibited transgene expression by in vitrotransfected endothelial cells, and incubation of macrophages with LDC in vitro triggered production of both IFN-A and IFN-B. Therefore, type I IFNs appear to play a key role in suppressing transgene expression in vivo following systemic nonviral gene delivery using LDC.  INTRODUCTION Intravenous gene delivery using nonviral vectors such as cationic liposome–DNA complexes (LDC) is an attractive approach to systemic gene delivery to organs such as the lungs and liver for gene replacement therapy or for the treatment of cancer [1–6]. For example, we showed that cytokine gene delivery using LDC was an effective means of controlling lung tumor metastases [7]. Liposome–DNAmediated delivery of antiangiogenic genes has also been shown to target angiogenic tumor vasculature and to inhibit the growth of primary and metastatic tumors in several different tumor models [2,3,8,9]. Other studies have also revealed that the LDC are themselves extremely immunostimulatory, which accounts in part for their toxicity [10–13]. These immunostimulatory properties of LDC can also be harnessed for therapeutic benefit, for example in the treatment of tumors [3,12–15]. Therefore, activation of innate immunity appears to be an inherent aspect of systemic gene delivery using LDC. Persistent gene expression has been difficult to achieve in vivo following systemic gene delivery using either viral or nonviral vectors. In the case of viral vectors, both vector-specific and nonspecific immune responses have been implicated in downregulating transgene expression. For example, in vivo administration of adenoviral vectors elicits innate immune responses, including release of interferons (IFNs), that rapidly downmodulate transgene expression [16–19]. Furthermore, IFN-a also impaired early transgene expression after adenovirus-mediated gene transfer into muscle cells [20]. Systemic delivery of plasmid-based expression vectors using liposomes also results in transient gene expression, typically of less than a few daysT duration in vivo [1,21]. Though newer vectors may partially overcome this effect, the problem still persists [22]. Stimulation of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) release was reported to be responsible for at least a portion of the downmodulation of gene expression after systemic gene delivery using LDC [11,23].  However, LDC also trigger release of other proinflammatory cytokines, some of which could also play an important role in downmodulation of transgene expression [24]. For example, bacterial DNA is a potent trigger for release of IFN-a by macrophages and dendritic cells through triggering of Toll-like receptor 9 [25,26]. Moreover, interferons, including IFN-g, IFN-h, and IFN-a, have all been shown in vitro to downmodulate transgene expression following transfection using LDC [27–29]. Previous studies to identify the role of inflammatory cytokines in downmodulation of transgene expression following in vivo gene delivery have typically relied on antibody depletion studies or addition of high doses of exogenous cytokines. Both of these approaches are subject to certain pitfalls, including the failure to deplete cytokines adequately in vivo or the creation of nonphysiological conditions. We decided therefore to readdress the issue of cytokine downmodulation of transgene expression following in vivo gene delivery with LDC and particularly to assess the potential role of type I IFNs. In the studies reported here, we relied on genetically manipulated mice lacking functional cytokine receptor genes. In vitro assays with endothelial cells and macrophages were also used to assess the effects of type I IFNs on transgene expression and the effects of LDC on type I IFN release, as these two cell types are primary targets for LDC uptake and transfection in vivo [1]. We found that type I IFNs played a major role in downmodulating reporter gene expression both in vivo and in vitro following liposome–DNA-mediated gene delivery. Intravenous gene delivery elicited release of high circulating concentrations of both IFN-a and IFN-h in vivo, and serum from injected animals was capable of suppressing transfection in vitro. In vitro, IFN-h and IFNa both suppressed transgene expression by cultured lung capillary endothelial cells. Interestingly, LDC triggered production of high concentrations of IFN-h and IFN-a by macrophages and fibroblasts in vitro, but did not trigger production of type I IFNs by endothelial cells. These results indicate that type I IFNs play a key role as negative regulators of transgene expression in the lungs and other tissues following nonviral gene delivery using LDC. RESULTS NK Cell Depletion Does Not Prolong Transgene Expression in Vivo Interferon-g has been implicated previously in suppressing transgene expression following in vivo gene delivery with LDC [11]. Our earlier studies had also indicated that NK cells were the primary source of IFN-g release following intravenous injection of LDC [12]. Therefore, we first assessed the effects of depleting NK cells on transgene expression in vivo. For these experiments, we depleted mice of NK cells by injecting anti-asialo-GM1 antiserum (Wako Bioproducts, Richmond, VA, USA) 48 h prior to injecting LDC, which was shown previously to eliminate virtually all IFN-g release. Following NK cell depletion, we injected LDC intravenously and quantitated the level of luciferase expression in the lungs 7 days later. We found that the level of luciferase gene expression in lung tissues rapidly declined in untreated control mice (four animals per treatment group) from a mean of 450 pg/ml tissue lysate (F110 pg/ml) at 24 h postinjection to a mean of 8.3 pg/ml at day 7 postinjection (P b 0.01). The level of luciferase expression in lung tissues of NK-cell-depleted mice at day 7 postinjection was not significantly different from that of control mice (9.0 pg/ml tissue lysate). Thus, selective depletion of NK cells was not effective in prolonging the duration of in vivo gene expression following gene delivery by LDC. Intravenous Injection of LDC Elicits Production of IFN-A and IFN-B in Vivo Liposome–DNA complexes have been shown previously to elicit production and release of high levels of TNF and IFN-g in vivo [7,13]. However, the ability of LDC to elicit production of type I IFNs in vivo has not been previously assessed. Therefore, we measured type I IFNs in serum of mice (three per group) injected intravenously with LDC. We collected serum 6 h after intravenous injection of LDC and determined the concentration of IFN-a and IFN-h. We detected high concentrations of both IFN-a (11.1 F 0.35 ng/ml postinjection) and IFN-h (6.3 F 3.4 ng/ml postinjection) in serum of mice injected with LDC, but not in control mice (IFN-a 0.08 F 0.03 ng/ml and IFN-h 0.1 F 0.05 ng/ml). Kinetic studies revealed that production of type I IFNs was maximal by 4-8 h and declined thereafter (data not shown). Thus, intravenous injection of LDC was a potent stimulus for systemic release of type I IFNs. Transgene Expression in Vivo Is Markedly Increased in IFN-A/B-R/ Mice Compared to Wild-Type Mice or IFN-;-R/ or TNF-R/ Mice The preceding experiments suggested that type I IFNs might play a more important role than previously appreciated in regulating transgene expression in vivo following intravenous gene delivery with LDC. To assess more fully the role of type I IFNs, we utilized mice unable to respond to type I IFNs due to a targeted genetic disruption in the type I IFN receptor (IFN-a/h-R/ mice) [30]. These mice are unable to respond to any of the multiple forms of IFN-a or to IFN-h. To compare the role of type I IFNs to that of IFN-g, which has previously been associated with downregulation of transgene expression in vivo,we also utilized mice lacking a functional IFN-g receptor (IFN-g-R/). The role of TNF in downmodulation of transgene expression was also evaluated by use of  mice lacking expression of both TNF receptors (TNF-p55/ p75/ mice, hereafter referred to simply as TNF-R/ mice). All mice used in these studies were bred on the same background strain (129 Sv) and the levels of gene expression in cytokine receptor / mice were compared to those of wild-type mice of the same background strain. We observed a striking increase in luciferase gene expression in all tissues examined in IFN-a/h-R/ mice 24 h after intravenous gene delivery with LDC, compared to luciferase expression in tissues of wild-type mice or mice lacking IFN-g or TNF receptors (Fig. 1). For example, the levels of luciferase gene expression in the lungs, heart, liver, and spleen tissues of IFN-a/h-R/ mice were 19-, 27-, 770-, and 117-fold higher, respectively, than the levels expressed in lung, heart, liver, and spleen tissues of wild-type mice. Luciferase expression in lung tissues of IFN-g-R/ mice was also significantly higher (5-fold increase) than in lung tissues of wild-type mice, whereas luciferase expression was not significantly different in lung tissues of mice lacking functional TNF receptors (Fig. 1A). We also demonstrated the effects of lack of type I IFN receptor expression on gene transfection efficiency using an in vivo live animal imaging system. We injected wildtype and IFN-a/h-R/ mice intravenously with lucifer  ase LDC and then 24 h later subjected them to in vivo imaging for detection of luciferase expression, as described under Materials and Methods (Fig. 1B). The live imaging studies revealed a marked increase in luciferase expression in the lungs of the IFN-a/h-R/ mice. We used a lower dose of plasmid DNA (10 Ag per mouse) in these assays to facilitate recovery from anesthesia by the injected animals. It should also be noted that the highest levels of luciferase expression in both wild-type and IFN-a/h-R/ mice were found in the lung tissues, as had been noted previously using tissue luciferase assays. These results indicated therefore that type I IFNs played a critical role in the rapid downmodulation of transgene expression early after in vivo gene delivery using LDC. Moreover, the effects of type I IFNs on suppressing gene expression were not confined to suppression of transgene expression in the lungs, as we observed significant increases in transgene expression in all organs examined in IFN-a/h-R/ mice. Comparison of Transgene Expression in Wild-Type and IFN-A/B-R/ Mice at 7 and 14 Days after Intravenous Gene Delivery Using LDC We wondered next whether transgene expression would persist beyond the first 24-48 h in IFN-a/h-R/ mice. To address this question, we compared luciferase expression levels in the lungs of wild-type, IFN-a/hR/, IFN-g-R/, and TNF-R/ mice at 7 and 14 days following gene delivery with LDC. In wild-type mice, luciferase gene expression in the lungs declined rapidly 48 h after iv injection and was virtually undetectable by 1 week postinjection (Fig. 2). In contrast, luciferase expression in the lungs of IFN-a/h-R/ mice was 40- fold higher at 7 days postinjection than in wild-type mice (P b 0.001). Luciferase gene expression in the lungs of IFN-g-R/ mice was also significantly higher than in wild-type mice (16-fold higher), but was still significantly lower (P = 0.005) than in IFN-a/h-R/ mice. Gene expression in the lungs of mice lacking functional TNF receptors was only slightly higher at 7 days than in wild-type mice. By 14 days postinjection, gene expression was no longer detectable in the lungs of wild-type mice and barely detectable in lungs of IFN-g-R/ or TNF-R/ mice, whereas IFN-a/h-R/ mice still had low but clearly detectable levels of luciferase gene expression in their lungs (Fig. 2). Thus, the inability to respond to type I IFNs not only greatly increased gene expression in vivo early after transfection (24 h), but also resulted in sustained gene expression at 1 and 2 weeks postinjection. The inability to respond to IFN-g resulted in a modest increase in gene expression in vivo at 24 h and 7 days, but the effects of IFN-g were much less pronounced than the effects of type I IFNs in suppressing transgene expression in vivo. The effects of type I IFNs on downmodulating gene expression were most pronounced in the first 24 h after in vivo gene delivery. However, the rate of decline in luciferase expression levels between 24 h and 7 and 14 days was similar in wild-type, IFN-g-R/, and IFN-ahR/ mice. Thus, the apparent persistence of in vivo gene expression in tissues of IFN-a/h-R/ mice at 7 and 14 days posttransfection was most likely a reflection of the higher initial starting levels of gene expression, rather than true persistence of expression per se. To determine whether apoptosis of transfected cells might have accounted for the gradual but steady loss of gene expression in vivo, we also did intravenous gene delivery experiments in vivo in lpr mice, which fail to express a functional fas gene product. These studies revealed that luciferase expression in tissues of lpr mice was not significantly different from that of wild-type mice at 7 days postinjection (data not shown). Therefore, we concluded that Fas-mediated apoptosis of target cells was unlikely to have accounted for the gradual loss of in vivo gene expression observed in IFN-a/h-R/ mice, though induction of apoptosis through other pathways could not be excluded as an explanation for the steady decline in gene expression.  Recombinant IFN-A and IFN-B Inhibit Transgene Expression by Endothelial Cells in Vitro Previous reports have indicated that pulmonary capillary endothelial cells are the major targets for in vivo transfection following intravenous gene delivery using LDC [1,6]. Therefore, we used a nontransformed mouse pulmonary capillary endothelial cell line (CD3; kindly provided by C. Diglio, Wayne State University) to investigate the effects of type I IFNs on transgene expression by endothelial cells. The CD3 endothelial cells were readily transfected in vitro, using the same LDC utilized for in vivo gene delivery (Fig. 3). Increasing concentrations of recombinant murine IFN-a or IFN-h were added to endothelial cells immediately after transfection and we assessed their effects on luciferase gene expression. We found that both IFN-a and IFN-h potently inhibited luciferase expression by the transfected endothelial cells. In general, the inhibitory effects of type I IFNs on endothelial cell transgene expression were more potent than those of IFN-g or TNF-a (data not shown), though direct comparisons were difficult to make. Serum from Mice Injected with LDC Inhibits Endothelial Cell Transgene Expression Inasmuch as endothelial cells are the primary target cells for transfection in the lungs after intravenous gene delivery, the decline in gene expression in the lungs over time was likely to reflect a decline in expression by lung capillary endothelial cells. Downmodulation of transgene expression by endothelial cells could have been mediated by cytokines present in circulation. To address this possibility, we added serum from mice injected with LDC to endothelial cells that had been transfected in vitro and quantitated the effects of serum exposure on luciferase expression 24 h later. Addition of 1% v/v serum from LDC-injected mice caused a 52% decrease in luciferase gene expression by transfected endothelial cells, whereas addition of control serum did not cause a decline in transgene expression (expression was 101% of control levels of luciferase expression by transfected endothelial cells). At higher serum concentrations, we observed nonspecific inhibition of luciferase expression by normal serum (data not shown). Thus, it appeared that circulating concentrations of cytokines were sufficient to suppress transgene expression by lung endothelial cells. Liposome–DNA Complexes Elicit Production of IFN-A and IFN-B by Macrophages and Fibroblasts, but Not by Endothelial Cells The preceding experiments established the importance of type I IFNs in downmodulating transgene expression following transfection in vivo and in vitro. Therefore, we wished next to determine the source of production of type I IFNs. Macrophages are known to be one of the major target cells for uptake of LDC in the spleen following intravenous gene delivery, though they are not very efficient at gene expression [6,8]. Therefore, we evaluated the release of type I IFNs by macrophages and other cell types following exposure to LDC in vitro. We found that macrophages produced significant quantities of both IFN-a and IFN-h following exposure to LDC (Fig. 4). In addition, normal kidney fibroblasts derived from wild-type mice also produced substantial levels of both IFN-a and IFN-h following exposure to LDC in vitro. Dendritic cells may also take up LDC in vivo and we found that bone marrow DC also produced significant quantities of IFN-a and IFN-h in vitro after exposure to LDC (data not shown). In marked contrast, lung endothelial cells did not produce detectable concentrations of either IFN-a or IFN-h following transfection with LDC, despite repeated attempts to detect the cytokines. Thus, induction of type I IFN production by LDC is not a property shared by all cells. The failure of endothelial cells to produce type I IFNs was not, however, due to lack of uptake of LDC, as the endothelial cells were capable of being transfected (see Fig. 3). Transfection Efficiency Is Increased in Bone Marrow Macrophages and Normal Fibroblasts from IFN-A/B-R/ Mice Finally, we wished to determine whether autocrine induction of type I IFN release following transfection with LDC could suppress transgene expression. To address this question, we used primary cultures of bone marrow macrophages derived from either wildtype or IFN-a/h-R/ mice. We also did similar experiments using normal kidney fibroblast cell lines derived from wild-type and IFN-a/h-R/ mice. We found that  observed in IFN-g-R/ mice at 24 h posttransfection in our studies (Fig. 1). However, the magnitude of increase in transgene expression observed in that prior study was much less than was observed in the IFN-a/h-R/ mice in the present study. Another study using defined oligonucleotides and treatment with dexamethasone also suggested an association between induction of proinflammatory cytokines (especially TNF-a) and suppression of both transgene expression and the inability to retransfect mice in vivo [31]. A recent report has also indicated that concurrent administration of immunomodulatory drugs in liposomes (e.g., dexamethasone or NSAIDs) may substantially attenuate the inflammatory response associated with gene delivery using LDC in vivo [32]. Another recent report also suggests a role for increased levels of IL-10 in prolonging transgene expression in tumor-bearing mice in vivo, compared to nontumor-bearing mice [33]. Taken together, these results all point to an important role for activation of innate immunity in suppressing transgene expression following gene delivery using LDC. The exact mechanism(s) by which type I IFNs may downmodulate transgene expression following nonviral gene delivery in vivo are currently unknown, but previous in vitro studies suggest possible explanations. For example, transgene transcription driven by a cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter following in vitro transfection was decreased after treatment with IFN-a, as was the stability of mRNA transcripts [34]. The effects of IFNh on in vitro transcription following nonviral transfection have been less well studied. However, based on in vitro antibody-blocking experiments, it has been reported that release of IFN-h is involved in the downregulation of gene expression following adenovirusmediated gene delivery [29]. In another report, IFN-a suppressed expression of recombinant adenoviral transgene expression after gene delivery into muscle [19]. Thus, IFN-a and IFN-h, both of which are released at high levels following LDC-mediated gene delivery, may act synergistically through pathways that suppress transgene transcription. Our data also indicate that for some cell types, with the possible exception of capillary endothelial cells, induction of type I IFN release by the transfected cells themselves can serve as a potent autocrine suppressor of transgene expression. Since LDC resemble in many respects viral particles, it is likely that transfection using these complexes may elicit autocrine activation of antiviral immune responses, including the release of type I IFNs. One practical application of these findings would be the use of cell lines lacking type I IFN receptors to increase the efficiency of gene expression following in vitro lipofection. The downmodulation of transgene expression that occurs in vivo following nonviral gene delivery may involve two separate and possibly independent mechanisms. The first, rapidly activated, pathway may be a cytokine-dependent pathway that involves release of type I IFNs and other proinflammatory cytokines such as IFN-g. A second, slower onset and cytokine-independent, pathway for downregulation of transgene expression may also exist. For example, transgene expression declined significantly in IFN-a/h-R/ mice by 7 and 14 days after transfection, despite the very high initial levels of gene expression in these mice. Thus, an early cytokine-dependent mechanism may be responsible for establishing the initial level of transgene expression in vivo in the first 24 h posttransfection, whereas a cytokine-independent mechanism may be responsible for the steady decline in gene expression that occurs after 24 h. The slow decay phase of gene expression could be mediated by turnover of transfected endothelial cells, by immunologically mediated elimination of transfected cells, or by alternative pathways for interruption of transcription from the expression vector. For example, high levels of apoptosis have been reported previously in the lungs of mice injected with LDC [11]. Our results obtained with lpr mice suggest that induction of apoptosis by Fas-Fas ligand interactions could not entirely account for the observed decline in transgene expression over time in the lungs of injected mice, but would not exclude Fas-independent pathways for triggering of apoptosis of transfected cells. In summary, we have shown that expression of transgenes in vivo after delivery using a nonviral vector such as LDC is subject to strong negative regulation by induction of innate immune responses, particularly by release of type I IFNs. TNF and IFN-g appear to play a quantitatively less important role as negative regulators of transgene expression following gene delivery with LDC. These findings have important implications for achieving sustained production of therapeutic levels of gene expression in vivo. At present, modifications to vector design offer probably the best chance of improving the level and duration of in vivo gene expression, possibly by producing vectors that are resistant to the downmodulatory effects of cytokines of the innate immune system. Alternatively, the use of gene delivery systems that elicit less immune activation, or coadministration of pharmacologic inhibitors of cytokine release, may facilitate higher levels of gene expression in vivo. An example of the successful application of the latter approach has been reported recently [33]. Gene vector modifications that interrupt signaling via the type I IFN receptor may prove useful for increasing or prolonging in vivo gene expression. MATERIALS AND METHODS Reporter gene plasmid vectors. The CMV-luciferase plasmid expression vector (pGL3) used in these studies contained the luciferase cDNA under control of the CMV immediate early promoter, the bovine h-globin enhancer region, and the SV40 polyadenylation site [35].  Plasmid DNA and cationic liposomes. Plasmid DNA was prepared by alkaline lysis followed by chromatographic purification, as described previously [36]. The endotoxin content of the DNA was less than 0.1 EU/ Ag DNA, as determined by the LAL kinetic assay (Biowhittaker, Walkersville, MD, USA). Cationic liposomes comprising DOTIM (octadecenoyloxy(ethyl-2-heptadecenyl-3-hydroxyethyl) imidazolinium chloride) (Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO, USA) and cholesterol (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL, USA) were prepared as described previously by Templeton et al.[37]. Briefly, equimolar amounts of DOTIM and cholesterol were evaporated to dryness, then rehydrated in 5% dextrose in water (D5W) at 508C, and then extruded sequentially through filters of decreasing diameter (1000, 450, and 200 nm) to form extruded liposomes. Cationic LDC were formed by adding liposomes to D5W, then adding plasmid DNA, and mixing by gentle pipetting. The final DNA concentration was 100 Ag/ml, and the liposome-to-DNA ratio was 16 nmol lipid to 1.0 Ag DNA. Animals. Female 129 Sv/Ev mice were purchased from Taconic Laboratories (Indianapolis, IN, USA) and were used between 8 and 12 weeks of age. Cytokine receptor gene-disrupted mice used in these studies were all on the 129 Sv background strain. Interferon-g receptor gene / mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA). Double TNF-R gene-disrupted mice (p55/; p75/) were kindly provided by Dr. David Lynch (Immunex Corp.) and Dr. Philippa Marrack (National Jewish) [38]. Type I IFN receptor gene-disrupted mice (IFN-a/h-R/) were kindly provided by Drs. Michel Aguet and Robert Schreiber (Swiss Institute for Experimental Cancer Research, Lausanne, Switzerland, and Washington University School of Medicine, respectively) and by Dr. P. Marrack [30,39]. Mice with a point mutation in the fas gene (lpr mice) were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. All mice with cytokine receptor gene disruptions were phenotypically normal and otherwise indistinguishable from wild-type mice. Protocols for use of animals in these studies were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committees at the National Jewish Medical and Research Center and at Colorado State University. Cells and cell lines. The nontransformed murine capillary endothelial cell line (CD3) was a kind gift from Clement Diglio (Wayne State University). Bone marrow macrophage cultures were established as described previously [40]. Briefly, bone marrow was obtained from the femur of mice and erythrocytes were removed by ammonium chloride lysis. For generating bone marrow macrophages, the cells were suspended at 2  106 /ml and adhered to 24-well plates for 1 h, and then nonadherent cells were removed and the cells were cultured in complete medium (modified EagleTs medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Sigma-Aldrich), 2 mmol/L lglutamine, 1% nonessential amino acids, 50 IU/ml penicillin, 50 Ag/ ml streptomycin (all from Gibco, InVitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA)) supplemented with 10% v/v L-929 cell conditioned medium. Cells were used for studies when they were 5-6 days in culture. Primary kidney fibroblast cell lines were prepared by collagenase digestion from kidney tissues obtained from wild-type mice, IFN-a/h-R/ mice, TNF-R/ mice, and IFN-g-R/ mice. These cells were plated at a density of 2 105 cells per well in triplicate wells of a 24-well plate and allowed to grow to confluence. Cells were transfected in vitro with luciferase plasmid DNA for 2 h at 378C, using varying doses of plasmid DNA per well. The plasmid DNA was complexed to the same DOTIM-cholesterol liposomes at the same ratio as used for in vivo transfections. Samples were harvested for luciferase assay by three cycles of freeze-thawing in 0.5 ml cell lysis buffer. Luciferase concentration in vitro was expressed as luciferase activity per milliliter of solution. For assessment of cytokine release in vitro,cells were incubated with noncoding plasmid DNA complexed to DOTIM-cholesterol liposomes for 2 h and then refed with fresh medium, and the supernatants were collected 24 h later. The supernatants were stored at 808C prior to analysis. Cytokines and antibodies. Purified rabbit antibody to the NK cell surface protein asialo-GM1 was purchased from Wako Bioproducts. Recombinant murine IFN-a and IFN-h was purchased from Pierce Biotechnology (Iselin, NJ, USA). Recombinant IFN-g and TNF-a were purchased from eBiosciences (San Diego, CA, USA). Antibodies to IFN-a and IFN-h were purchased from Seikagaku/Cape Cod, Inc. (Falmouth, MA, USA) and US Biologicals (Swampscott, MA, USA). Injection of LDC and luciferase assay. Mice were injected by lateral tail vein with 200 Al LDC, to deliver a dose of 20 Ag plasmid DNA per mouse. Mice (three or four per treatment group) were sacrificed and lung, heart, spleen, and liver tissues (approximately 1 g each) were harvested for luciferase assay at various time points postinjection. The luciferase assay was done as described previously [37]. Briefly, lung and other tissues were homogenized in cell lysis buffer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratories, Madison, WI, USA) and then analyzed for luciferase content using a luciferase assay kit and a luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratories). The luciferase content of tissue samples was determined by comparison to a standard curve generated with recombinant luciferase (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). In some experiments, serum was collected by heart puncture 6 h after liposome-DNA complex injection and stored at 808C prior to cytokine analysis. Whole animal luciferase imaging studies. Mice to be imaged were anesthetized with isoflurane. Ten minutes prior to imaging, the mice were injected intraperitoneally with 100 Al of 30 mg/ml stock solution of luciferin (Xenogen Corp., Alameda, CA, USA). The mice were then placed in the imager and imaged for 5 min using the IVIS 100 Imager (Xenogen). Image analysis was performed using IGOR PRO software. Quantitation of cytokine release.

23	2010	Design and Evaluation of Doxorubicin-containing Microbubbles for Ultrasound-triggered Doxorubicin Delivery: Cytotoxicity and Mechanisms Involved	Drug delivery with microbubbles and ultrasound is gaining more and more attention in the drug delivery field due to its noninvasiveness, local applicability, and proven safety in ultrasonic imaging techniques. In this article, we tried to improve the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin (DOX)-containing liposomes by preparing DOXliposome-containing microbubbles for drug delivery with therapeutic ultrasound. In this way, the DOX release and uptake can be restricted to ultrasound-treated areas. Compared to DOX-liposomes, DOX-loaded microbubbles killed at least two times more melanoma cells after exposure to ultrasound. After treatment of the melanoma cells with DOX-liposome-loaded microbubbles and ultrasound, DOX was mainly present in the nuclei of the cancer cells, whereas it was mainly detected in the cytoplasm of cells treated with DOX-liposomes. Exposure of cells to DOX-liposome-loaded microbubbles and ultrasound caused an almost instantaneous cellular entry of the DOX. At least two mechanisms were identified that explain the fast uptake of DOX and the superior cell killing of DOX-liposome-loaded microbubbles and ultrasound. First, exposure of DOX-liposome-loaded microbubbles to ultrasound results in the release of free DOX that is more cytotoxic than DOX-liposomes. Second, the cellular entry of the released DOX is facilitated due to sonoporation of the cell membranes. The in vitro results shown in this article indicate that DOXliposome-loaded microbubbles could be a very interesting tool to obtain an efficient ultrasound-controlled DOX delivery in vivo. Received 26 March 2009; accepted 18 June 2009; published online 21 July 2009. doi:10.1038/mt.2009.160 Introduction Doxorubicin (DOX), also called adriamycin, is one of the most frequently used anticancer drugs. DOX is used for the treatment of different solid and hematopoietic cancers such as breast cancer, osteosarcomas, aggressive lymphomas, and leukemias. Different mechanisms explain its cytotoxic activity.1  They include DNA intercalation, lipid peroxidation, and inhibition of topoisomerase II. The use of free DOX is rather limited because of the severe side effects. Indeed, besides damaging tumors, it also causes cardiotoxicity and nephrotoxicity.1  Additionally, the efficacy of free DOX is also hampered by multidrug resistance, originating from the P-glycoprotein and topoisomerase II resistance.1  Because of these problems associated with free DOX treatment, DOX has been encapsulated inside liposomes. These liposomes contain PEG (polyethylene glycol) chains at their surface to prevent recognition by the reticuloendothelial system (so-called stealth liposomes). This results in the passive accumulation of stealth liposomes in the tumor vasculature due to the enhanced permeability and retention effect.2  In 1995, the liposomal DOX formulations Doxil and Caelyx became FDA-approved for the treatment of AIDS-related Kaposi’s sarcoma and ovarian cancer. Although Doxil strongly reduced the cardiotoxicity of DOX in clinical trials, other side effects occurred. Several patients suffered from mucositis and the hand and foot syndrome due to the localization of the liposomes in skin capillaries.1  Therefore, many research groups try to enhance the targeting of DOX to the tumors by attaching ligands or antibodies to DOX-loaded vehicles or by incorporating DOX in stimuli-responsive carriers like pH and temperatureresponsive nanocarriers.1,3 In the past, ultrasound has been used as an external trigger to induce drug release from drug-loaded carriers. In these experiments, low frequency (<1MHz) ultrasound was used. More recently, it has been demonstrated that high-frequency ultrasound (1–10MHz), when combined with diagnostic microbubbles, can enhance the intracellular delivery and extravasation of drugs.4–9 These effects have been attributed to inertial cavitation of the microbubbles. Cavitation is the alternate growing and shrinking of microbubbles under the influence of an ultrasonic field.10 When the ultrasound intensity is high enough, microbubbles can implode due to the inertia of the inrushing fluid (inertial cavitation). As a result, several groups have shown that fluid streams and microjets develop that can transiently perforate the membranes of nearby cells and hence enhance the intracellular uptake of drugs.9,11–14 This phenomenon is called sonoporation. Additionally, it has been shown that such microjets can also transiently perforate blood vessels and thus induce extravasation of large molecules.15,16   ltrasound.17 However, these papers mainly focused on ultrasoundassisted intracellular delivery of free DOX18,19 or DOX encapsulated in micelles or liposomes.20–23 The forces associated with the inertial cavitation of the microbubbles may (i) massively release the encapsulated drug from the nanocarriers and (ii) improve the intracellular uptake of DOX due to sonoporation of the cell membranes. However, a major drawback of co-injecting DOX-liposomes and microbubbles is the fact that DOX-liposomes can still extravasate and accumulate in undesired tissues (not exposed to ultrasound), like the skin capillaries.1  This can still result in unwanted side effects. Coupling of the liposomes to the microbubbles could prevent this, as microbubbles attached to the microbubble wall will no longer be able to extravasate. This study aimed to further improve ultrasoundmediated delivery of DOX-liposomes. Therefore, we designed “DOX-loaded microbubbles” through avidin–biotin binding of DOX-containing liposomes to the lipid shell of microbubbles (DOX-liposome-loaded microbubbles) (Figure 1). DOX delivery by such constructs could be attractive, as it would take profit of both the sonoporation effect and targeting potential of ultrasound. Indeed, microbubbles carrying DOX-liposomes at their surface are expected to be too large to extravasate in undesired tissue (i.e., not treated by ultrasound). Only after ultrasound-mediated release of DOX-liposome, extravasation can occur at especially these regions that are treated with ultrasound. This paper shows the killing of tumor cells by DOX-liposome-loaded microbubbles and explains the underlying mechanisms. Results Design and characterization of DOX-liposome-loaded microbubbles As schematically presented in Figure 1, we aimed to construct lipid microbubbles loaded with DOX-liposomes. Therefore, we first prepared DOX-containing liposomes composed of 55 mol% dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, 40 mol% cholesterol, and 5 mol% DSPE-PEG-biotin ((1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3phosphoethanolamine-N-(biotinyl(polyethyleneglycol)2000)). After loading the liposomes with DOX and gel permeation chromatography purification, DOX-liposomes with an average diameter of 147 nm were obtained. We also prepared lipid-shelled microbubbles that contained 15 mol% DSPEPEG-biotin in their shell. The biotinylated microbubbles were subsequently incubated with an excess of avidin to saturate the biotin molecules at their surface. After removal of the excess of avidin, the microbubbles were incubated with the biotinylated DOX-liposomes to couple the DOX-liposomes on the microbubbles via an avidin–biotin bridge (Figure 1). The binding of the DOX-liposomes, which are fluorescent due to the presence of DOX, on the microbubbles was confirmed via confocal laser scanning microscopy: Figure 2 clearly shows that the surface of the microbubbles becomes surrounded by DOX-containing liposomes. The amount of DOX-liposomes that was bound to the microbubbles was estimated by removing the unbound DOX-liposomes from the microbubbles via centrifugation. We measured that 65% of the DOX-liposomes was attached to the microbubbles. Knowing that we mixed about 1 × 109  microbubbles with 50 µg of DOX encapsulated in liposomes, each microbubble contains about 3.25 × 10−8 µg DOX. Efficacy of DOX-liposome-loaded microbubbles after ultrasound treatment In Figure 3, the killing of cancer cells by DOX-liposome-loaded microbubbles, in the presence of ultrasound, and DOX-liposomes is compared. The cell killing by DOX-liposomes (light gray bars) was rather limited; the highest concentrations (50 and 100µg/ml) killed about 50% of the cells. In contrast, DOX-liposomes attached onto the microbubbles (white bars) were by far more toxic to the cells after ultrasound application. We also observed a nice correlation between the liposome concentration present on the DOXliposome-loaded microbubbles and the cell viability, which was less clear in case DOX-liposomes were used. Some groups described a synergistic effect of ultrasound on the killing of cells by DOX-liposomes24 and DOX-micelles,22,25,26 though we did not observe an outspoken improvement of the cell   killing by DOX-liposomes when ultrasound was applied (Figure 3: dark gray bars). Most authors use low-frequency ultrasound (20–100 kHz), which is known to favor cavitation at relatively low intensities, even in the absence of microbubbles. In our experiment, we exposed the DOX-liposomes to 1MHz frequency ultrasound in the absence of microbubbles. Under these ultrasound conditions, it is well known that cavitation is limited and probably too low to release the DOX from the liposomes or to perforate cell membranes. In contrast, DOX-liposome-loaded microbubbles in the presence of ultrasound significantly lowered the overall viability of the melanoma cells. We observed previously that the ultrasound conditions used in this study may detach a (small) part of the cells from the OptiCell membrane. Therefore, we also studied the effect of microbubbles (not loaded with DOX-liposomes) and ultrasound on the viability of the melanoma cells. As Figure 3 shows, this reduced the cell viability to about 10%. Even though if we take this into account, DOX-liposome-loaded microbubbles and ultrasound seemed much more efficient in killing cancer cells than free DOX-liposomes. Intracellular localization of DOX We tried to gain more insight into the intracellular DOX concentrations in the melanoma cells (Figure 4). Different concentrations of DOX-liposomes and DOX-liposome-loaded microbubbles were added to the cells. After 4 hours, the cells were washed and DOX uptake was visualized by confocal laser scanning microscopy. At the lowest DOX concentration (30µg/ml), we could detect more DOX in cells exposed to DOX-liposome-loaded microbubbles and ultrasound than in cells exposed to DOX-liposomes. This was less obvious at higher DOX concentrations used. The intracellular distribution of DOX seemed to strongly depend on the way the DOX was delivered to the cells. It was almost exclusively localized in the nuclei when the cells were treated with the DOXliposome-loaded microbubbles and ultrasound, whereas DOX was found in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus of cells treated with DOX-liposomes. Sometimes a punctuated pattern could be seen in the cytoplasm of these cells (indicated by white arrows in Figure 4), which suggests that the DOX locates in endosomes. Two simultaneously occurring phenomena may explain the different intracellular distribution of DOX. First, after exposure of cells to DOX-liposome-loaded microbubbles and ultrasound, free DOX (released from the liposomes destroyed by the ultrasound) probably enters the cells and accumulates in the nucleus because of its high affinity for DNA,27 which is abundantly present in the nucleus. Second, Schlicher et al.28 recently described the existence of exocytosis after exposure of cells to ultrasound and microbubbles to reseal the pores in the cell membranes. The transport of vesicles from the inside to the outside of the cell may limit endocytosis and thus reduce the amount of free DOX or DOX-liposomes that is taken up by endocytosis. The higher amount of DOX in the nuclei after exposure of the cells to DOX-liposome-loaded microbubbles and ultrasound suggests the following delivery mechanism. Applying ultrasound destroys the liposomes on the microbubbles releasing free DOX near the cell membranes, which can enter cells more easily than DOX-liposomes. Second, ultrasound may also increase the amount of free DOX and DOX-liposomes that enter the cells via perforations in the membranes. In the following paragraphs, we further investigate the mechanisms that may explain the stronger cell killing by DOX-loaded microbubbles and ultrasound. Is the stronger cell killing by DOX-liposome-loaded microbubbles due to an ultrasound-mediated release of free DOX from the liposomes? Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the synergistic effect of ultrasound on the biological activity of anticancer drugs. The first mechanism postulates that ultrasound treatment of DOX-liposomes results in the release of DOX from the liposomes that subsequently enters the cells via passive diffusion and pinocytosis.29 To verify this hypothesis, a direct effect of the cavitating microbubbles on the cell membrane should be avoided so that only the cytotoxic effect coming from DOX can be taken into account. Therefore, we performed an experiment in which the DOX-liposome-loaded microbubbles were first exposed to ultrasound (using the same settings as in Figure 3) in an “empty” OptiCell (i.e., without melanoma cells). Subsequently, this “medium” (i.e., the debris of radiated DOX-liposomeloaded microbubbles) was transferred to an OptiCell in which melanoma cells were growing. In this experiment, sonoporation of the melanoma cells (by cavitating and imploding microbubbles cavitating) was thus avoided. After 4 hours of incubation, the “medium” was removed and the cell viability was measured 48 hours later. Figure 5 shows that the debris of radiated DOXliposome-loaded microbubbles (white bars) showed a stronger tumor cell killing than DOX-liposomes (light gray bars). These data indicate that exposure of DOX-liposome-loaded microbubbles to ultrasound most likely results in the release of  release of free DOX and the cavitation of the microbubbles that perforates the cell membranes. We recently loaded PEGylated plasmid DNA– or small interfering RNA–containing liposomes (lipoplexes) onto the same type of microbubbles as reported in this study.6,7 We could show by dynamic light scattering that exposure of the lipoplex-loaded microbubbles resulted in the release of intact lipoplexes. However, after exposure of the DOX-liposome-loaded microbubbles to ultrasound, we were no longer able to detect DOX-liposomes. This further suggests that indeed a substantial part of the DOXliposomes becomes destroyed upon applying ultrasound to the DOX-liposome-loaded microbubbles. Probably, this results in the release of free DOX that can enter the cells either via passive diffusion or through the perforations in the cell membranes, as discussed in the next paragraph. Is the stronger cell killing by DOX-liposome-loaded microbubbles due to an improved cellular uptake of DOX? Several groups have studied the perforation of cell membranes by ultrasound.9,28,30,31 Scanning electron microscopy images and uptake of fluorescent molecules after sonoporation have proven that cavitating microbubbles can indeed transiently disrupt cell membranes that allow compounds to enter cells. In our study, pore formation might enhance the intracellular uptake of both free DOX and DOX-liposomes. To further evaluate this hypothesis, we studied the cellular uptake of DOX shortly (i.e., 15–30 minutes) after exposure of melanoma cells to (i) DOX-liposome-loaded microbubbles and ultrasound (Figure 6a–d), (ii) DOX-liposomes (Figure 6e–h), and (iii) free DOX (Figure 6i–l). Almost immediately after exposure of the melanoma cells to DOX-liposomeloaded microbubbles and ultrasound, a substantial part of the cells contained very high levels of DOX in their nuclei (Figure 6a,c). In sharp contrast, melanoma cells exposed to DOX-liposomes hardly contained DOX after 15 minutes (Figure 6e,g). Free DOX is known to be easily taken up by cells through a combined process of passive diffusion and active transport mechanisms.29 Therefore, we also studied the uptake of free DOX (Figure 6i–l). After 15 minutes,   cells treated with free DOX contained clearly visible amounts of DOX (Figure 6i,k) in the cytoplasm with only very little fluorescence in the nucleus of the cells. However, the amount of DOX internalized by the cells was still much lower than the DOX content in the cells exposed to DOX-liposome-loaded microbubbles and ultrasound. Note that in the case of DOX­liposome-loaded microbubbles, a part of the cells had taken up extreme amounts of DOX 15 minutes after exposure to ultrasound (these were probably the cells that were in contact with cavitating and imploding microbubbles), whereas the others were only weakly fluorescent (Figure 6a). In the case of free DOX, the fluorescence was rather equal in all the cells that suggests that DOX uptake occurred to the same extent in all the cells. Several papers have reported the instant uptake of larger molecules after sonoporation.32–34 It has been shown that the microstreams developing around a cavitating microbubble, and especially the shock waves and microjets associated with microbubble cavitation, can result in the formation of transient pores in the cell membrane.35,36 Pore sizes between 100nm and a few micrometers in size have been reported,28,31 implying that a rather small molecule like DOX should be able to enter the cell through such cell membrane pores. To further evaluate the hypothesis that microbubbles in the presence of ultrasound enhance the cellular uptake of DOX, we compared the killing of cells that had been exposed to free DOX and a mixture of free DOX, microbubbles, and ultrasound. As presented in Figure 7, microbubbles in combination with ultrasound significantly enhanced the cytotoxicity of free DOX (dark gray bars). This supports the hypothesis that sonoporation indeed improves the cellular uptake of free DOX. We also performed a second experiment in which we first exposed the melanoma cells to free DOX; after the 4-hour incubation time, the cells were carefully washed and treated with microbubbles and ultrasound. As can be seen in Figure 7 (white bars), this even resulted in a stronger killing that may be due to the fact that a certain time after internalization of free DOX, melanoma cells become more sensitive to sonoporation. Cells treated with microbubbles and   ultrasound are often irregularly shaped.30 This was also observed in our experiments (Figure 6d). Despite their clearly damaged cell membrane, most cells are capable of resealing their membrane wounds,30,37 which was confirmed in our (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) experiment: only 10% of the BLM cells was metabolically inactive after exposure of the cells to microbubbles and ultrasound (Figure 3). It might be possible that due to the DOX-induced cytotoxicity, the cells are less able to generate cell repair mechanisms necessary to repair the cell membrane after sonoporation. Discussion We succeeded in coupling DOX-containing liposomes onto the lipid shell of gas-filled microbubbles. DOX-liposome-loaded microbubbles exposed to ultrasound killed much more tumor cells than DOX-liposomes. We showed that this is due to (i) an ultrasound-triggered release of DOX from the DOX-liposomes present on the microbubbles and (ii) an enhanced uptake of the released DOX by the cells. Based on the results in this article, we hypothesize that DOX-liposome-loaded microbubbles in combination with ultrasound may significantly improve the in vivo efficacy of Doxil, being the liposomal DOX formulation that is nowadays used in the clinic. Indeed, a local ultrasound-triggered release of free DOX in the tumor may enhance the cell killing by Doxil, as free DOX is expected to be more efficient than DOXliposomes. Also, DOX-liposome-loaded microbubbles may show less side effects than Doxil, as in tissues not exposed to ultrasound, the micron-sized DOX-liposome-loaded bubbles (i) will stay intact and thus will not release DOX-liposomes and (ii) will not extravasate into these tissues. Moreover, the cavitation and implosion of the microbubbles in the tumor microvasculature may perforate endothelial cells and enhance the extravasation of the released DOX.15,16 Although a direct contact between the tumor cells and the imploding microbubbles might be restricted by the tumor endothelium, exposure of these endothelial cells to imploding DOX-carrying microbubbles might selectively stimulate the uptake of DOX in these cells and in this way potentiate the destruction of the tumor vasculature. As schematically shown in Figure 8, we hypothesize that the enhanced cellular uptake of DOX in endothelial cells may improve DOX to slow down angiogenesis and to break down the nutrient supply of the tumor cells.38 The in vivo biological response of the DOX-liposome-loaded microbubbles may be further enhanced by attaching ligands to the microbubbles that specifically bind to the tumor endothelium.39,40 Although several papers describe the use of ultrasound to improve drug release from nanoparticles and to enhance cellular uptake,25,26,41–43 only few have been published on the combined use of ultrasound and drug-loaded microbubbles to improve antitumor treatment.44,45 Tartis et al. already developed   a paclitaxel-­containing ultrasound contrast agent.45 In this study, the paclitaxel was dissolved in triacetin oil, which makes this type of microbubbles unsuited for hydrophilic drugs like DOX. Gao and colleagues were the first to report the design of a DOX-loaded microbubble that was able to release the DOX upon ultrasound treatment.44 The DOX was present in the shell of perfluorocarbon nanoparticles that vaporized and formed DOXcarrying microbubbles upon warming till 37 °C. Although they obtained good results both in vitro and in vivo, we believe that clinical application of the DOX-liposome-carrying microbubbles described in our study may be more straightforward as both DOX-liposomes (Doxil) and lipid microbubbles (e.g., the contrast agent Definity) are already used in clinical settings. Another advantage of the DOX-liposome-loaded microbubbles is their high DOX loading efficiency. We estimated the amount of encapsulated DOX attached to one microbubble to be 3.25 × 10−8 µg. Doxil is given as a single dose of 20mg/m2 . This corresponds to a dose of 40mg for an adult of about 80 kg. To reach this dose, we should administer about 1.23 × 1012 DOX-liposome-loaded microbubbles. The recommended dose of Definity, which contains 1.2 × 1010 ­microbubbles/ml, is 10 µl/kg body weight that makes 1010 microbubbles for a person of 80 kg. This is about 100 times lower than the number of DOX-loaded microbubbles we must inject to administer 40mg of DOX. However, it has been demonstrated that Definity doses that are 1,000 times higher than the recommended dose are well tolerated in primates.46,47 Also, the local release of the DOX in the tumor after exposure of the DOX-liposome-loaded microbubbles to ultrasound will most likely allow us to reduce the dose below 40mg. The calculations above demonstrate that we may expect clinical effects in humans at a typically used microbubble doses. Materials and Methods Preparation and characterization of lipid microbubbles containing DSPE-PEG-biotin. Liposomes containing dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine and DSPE-PEG-biotin in a 85:15 molar ratio were prepared as previously described.6  Briefly, the chloroform-dissolved lipids were put in a round-bottomed flask and the solvent was removed via evaporation followed by flushing with nitrogen. The obtained lipid film was subsequently hydrated in 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) buffer (20mmol/l HEPES, pH 7.4) at a final lipid concentration of 5mg/ml and incubated overnight at 4 °C to allow the formation of liposomes. The resulting liposomes were first extruded through a polycarbonate membrane (pore size of 0.2 µm) using a mini-extruder (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL). Subsequently, the extruded liposomes were sonicated with a 20 kHz probe (Branson 250 Sonifier; Branson Ultrasonics, Danbury, CT) in the presence of perfluorobutane gas (MW 238 g/mol; F2 Chemicals, Preston, UK). After sonication, the microbubbles were washed (to remove the excess of lipids) with 3ml fresh HEPES buffer and finally resuspended in 5 ml fresh HEPES buffer. To allow the attachment of biotinylated DOX-liposomes, the biotinylated microbubbles were incubated with 500 µl avidin (10mg/ml) and incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature. Subsequently, the microbubbles were centrifuged and washed again with 3ml fresh HEPES buffer. Finally, the microbubbles were resuspended in 5ml HEPES buffer. The mean size of these microbubbles was around 2 µm and their size distribution ranged between 0.5 and 10 µm. Preparation and characterization of biotinylated DOX liposomes. Liposomes containing dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, cholesterol, and DSPE-PEG-biotin in a 60:40:5 molar ratio were prepared as described above. Liposomes were loaded with DOX following the method previously established by Bolotin et al. 48 After removal of the chloroform, the lipid film was hydrated with ammonium sulfate buffer (250mmol/l). The resulting liposomes were extruded through a polycarbonate membrane (pore size of 0.1µm) as described above. Subsequently, the liposomes were dialyzed against pure distilled water overnight in a dialysis bag (MWCO 10,000, Spectra/Por Biotech; Spectrum Laboratories, Compton, CA) to remove the ammonium sulfate between the liposomes. Liposomes were loaded with DOX by mixing 1ml of liposomes with 1mg of DOX. This mixture was incubated for 4 hours at 65°C. Afterward, the free DOX was removed by passing the DOX-loaded liposomes over a Sephadex column (Sephadex G-75; Sigma-Aldrich, Bornem, Belgium). Loading efficiency was determined by measuring the absorbance of DOX in the DOX-liposome fraction and the free DOX at 450nm and was around 90%. The average hydrodynamic diameter of the PEGylated DOX-liposomes was determined by dynamic light scattering (Autosizer 4700; Malvern, Worcestershire, UK). Attachment of biotinylated DOX-liposomes to avidinylated microbubbles. 50µl of biotinylated DOX-liposomes was mixed with 1ml avidinylated microbubbles and incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes. The attachment of DOX-liposomes to the microbubbles was visualized using a Nikon EZC1-si confocal laser scanning microscope (Nikon, Brussels, Belgium) equipped with a ×40 objective. The 491nm line of this microscope was used to excite the DOX, and the DOX was detected with the 580nm detector. Cell culture. BLM cells (melanoma cells)49 were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) with the growth factor F12 and phenol red containing 2mmol/l glutamine, 10% heat deactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% penicillin–streptomycin (Gibco, Merelbeke, Belgium), and HEPES buffer (100mmol/l, pH 7.4). Cytotoxicity measurements. Cells were grown to 90% confluency in OptiCell units (Biocrystal, Westerville, OH) in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 . Subsequently, cells were washed with 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (Gibco) and DOX-liposome-loaded microbubbles, DOX-liposomes or free DOX (all in Opti-MEM; Gibco) were added to the cells. Therefore, we first mixed an appropriate amount of biotinylated DOX-liposomes (containing 10, 30, 50, or 100 µg of DOX) with 1 ml of the avidinylated microbubbles. After 5 minutes of incubation at room temperature, Opti-MEM was added to a final volume of 10 ml. The medium was prepared in a similar way for the experiments without microbubbles except that the microbubbles were substituted by an equal amount of Opti-MEM. The 10 ml medium was completely added to the OptiCell units (surface 50 cm2 ). Subsequently, the cells were placed in a water bath at 37 °C with an absorbing rubber at the bottom and immediately subjected to ultrasound radiation. The ultrasound radiation was performed by moving in 15 seconds a 22 mm ultrasound probe (Sonitron 2000; Rich-Mar, Inola, OK) over the whole surface of the OptiCell. In all the experiments with ultrasound, we used the following settings: 1MHz, 50% duty cycle, and an ultrasound intensity of 2W/cm2 . These settings correspond to a total energy delivery of 15 J/cm2  for the whole OptiCell plate, with an ultrasound peak intensity of 0.17MPa (mechanical index 0.17). Unless otherwise stated, cells were immediately treated with ultrasound after addition of DOX-liposomes, DOX-liposome-loaded microbubbles, or free DOX. Four hours after the addition of the DOX-liposomes, the DOX-liposome-loaded microbubbles, and free DOX, we removed the medium and washed the cells two times with phosphate-buffered saline before adding fresh culture medium. After 48 hours, the cells were incubated with 0.5 mg/ml MTT labeling reagent (Cell Proliferation Kit I; Roche Diagnostics, Vilvoorde, Belgium) for 4 hours. Afterward, the solubilization solution was added and cells were incubated overnight at 37 °C. The next day, the absorbance 	Ine Lentacker1, Bart Geers1, Joseph Demeester1, Stefaan C De Smedt1 and Niek N Sanders2
24	2012	Enhanced drug delivery capabilities from stents coated with absorbable polymer and crystalline drug	Current drug eluting stent (DES) technology is not optimized with regard to the pharmacokinetics of drug delivery. A novel, absorbable-coating sirolimus-eluting stent (AC-SES) was evaluated for its capacity to deliver drug more evenly within the intimal area rather than concentrating drug around the stent struts and for its ability to match coating erosion with drug release. The coating consisted of absorbable poly-lactide-coglycolic acid (PLGA) and crystalline sirolimus deposited by a dry-powder electrostatic process. The AC-SES demonstrated enhanced drug stability under simulated use conditions and consistent drug delivery balanced with coating erosion in a porcine coronary implant model. The initial drug burst was eliminated and drug release was sustained after implantation. The coating was absorbed within 90 days. Following implantation into porcine coronary arteries the AC-SES coating is distributed in the surrounding intimal tissue over the course of several weeks. Computational modeling of drug delivery characteristics demonstrates how distributed coating optimizes the load of drug immediately around each stent strut and extends drug delivery between stent struts. The result was a highly efficient arterial uptake of drug with superior performance to a clinical bare metal stent (BMS). Neointimal thickness (0.17±0.07 mm vs. 0.28± 0.11 mm) and area percent stenosis (22±9% vs. 35± 12%) were significantly reduced (pb0.05) by the AC-SES compared to the BMS 30 days after stent implantation in an overlap configuration in porcine coronary arteries. Inflammation was significantly reduced in the AC-SES compared to the BMS at both 30 and 90 days after implantation. Biocompatible, rapidly absorbable stent coatings enable the matching of drug release with coating erosion and provide for the controlled migration of coating material.  1. Introduction Coronary arterial drug-eluting stent (DES) significantly improved outcomes and reduced the need for additional interventions. Millions have benefited from this technology and the knowledge gained from extensive use of these products has provided insights into aspects of the technology critical to therapeutic effectiveness. Essential attributes include use of an underlying balloon delivery catheter optimized for flexibility and placement accuracy; a stent platform that minimizes strut thickness and a drug-eluting coating that optimizes local antiproliferative therapy with coating compositions that minimize any inflammatory response. Several lessons are emerging as dominant in the DES era – in particular the role of stent design and geometry, and the material and coating characteristics. Thinner struts, for example, reduce intimal hyperplasia and thrombotic potential, improving clinical outcomes [1,2]. Less clear is how to formulate the coating to optimize drug delivery and device biocompatibility. Restenosis is most likely in the months immediately following stent placement [3]. Injury to the vessel wall is a triggering event and a subsequent inflammatory response will continue to encourage neointimal hyperplasia and vascular restenosis. Any component of the DES that exacerbates the inflammatory response or delays healing of the vessel will prolong the risk of adverse events such as late stent thrombosis. Although most polymer coatings have some inflammatory potential [4], the coating is needed to secure the drug to the device during delivery and to control release of the drug after implantation.  Currently marketed DES often provides short-term delivery of the therapeutic drug and a much longer (usually permanent) presence of the potentially inflammatory polymer coating. Absorbable polymer coatings that fully degrade and leave a bare metal stent provide the opportunity for more optimum long-term biocompatibility [5]. Drug release from current DES coatings is controlled by the rates of water imbibition into the polymer coating, subsequent dissolution of the drug and diffusion of soluble drug out of the polymer matrix [6]. Release is therefore exponential with an initial burst phase corresponding to rapid dissolution of surface drug [7]. This burst release may present the artery with more drug than it can retain resulting in measurable systemic drug levels [8]. The ensuing exponential decay of drug delivery means that drug release is constantly declining such that the interval during which optimal drug dosing is achieved may be very limited. A common concern is that stent-based drug delivery patterns tend to track the structure of the stent scaffold [9–11], and that this might result in suboptimal dosing between the struts and excessive dosing adjacent to stent struts. We used in vivo and computational models to determine whether a DES product could reduce the peaks and valleys in drug concentration by creating a formulation whose coating could be deployed away from the strut to more uniformly distribute drug through the vessel wall. We further sought to determine if a coating material deployed in this manner could be made to absorb rapidly relative to the duration of drug elution without eliciting a significant inflammatory response. 2. Methods 2.1. AC-SES An absorbable coating-sirolimus-eluting stent (AC-SES: MiStent® Sirolimus Eluting Absorbable Polymer Coronary Stent System, Micell Technologies, Inc., Durham, NC) was based on a cobalt-chromium stent platform (GENIUS® Magic, Eurocor GmbH, Bonn Germany) [12] The stent has thin 0.0025 inch struts. The coating consists of sirolimus combined with an absorbable polymer, poly(lactide-coglycolic acid) (PLGA). Unique to this DES is the combination of the absorbable polymer and drug components using a dry powder electrostatic coating process. This product is not currently approved for commercial distribution. 2.2. Stent coating A detailed description of the stent coating procedure can be found in the supplemental materials and is outlined in Fig. 2. 2.3. SEM imaging Samples were sputter coated with platinum for 1.5 min to achieve a coating of approximately 15 nm. Imaging was performed at Evan Analytical Laboratories (Raleigh, NC) on a Hitachi S-4700 Field Emission scanning electron microscope. Images were acquired ranging from 35× to 5000× magnification. 2.4. Drug stability measurements Drug stability assessment under simulated use conditions was performed at Eurofins Medinet, Inc. (Aurora, CO). For these experiments drug stability within the AC-SES containing crystalline sirolimus was compared to sirolimus stability in a standard, commercially available DES product that consists of amorphous drug in a permanent polymer [7]. A total of six Cypher® DES controls (Cordis, Miami Lakes, FL) and twelve AC-SES were used for the stability assessment. The coating was dissolved and extracted from three controls and six AC-SES test articles by addition of 2 ml acetone:methanol (50:50) at baseline for reference to incubated stents. The remaining stents were incubated for 14 days in serum supplemented cell culture media at 37 °C. At the end of this period, the stents were removed and their coatings extracted as described above. Extracted samples were stored at −80 °C such that quantification was performed simultaneously on all samples. A fully validated method employing HPLC linked to tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) was used for analysis of sirolimus and degradants. The analysis was performed using an API 4000 Triple Quad Mass Spectrometer (AB Sciex Instruments) paired to a Waters Acquity HPLC system. Data were captured and analyzed within the Analyst 4.2.1 software package. Sirolimus content was analyzed to quantify relative amount of parent drug and primary degradants. 2.5. Flow loop studies An in vitro flow loop consisting of a 60 cm long, 3.35 mm diameter Silastic® tube was used to create controllable, vessel-like flow conditions as determined by velocity, pressure and wall shear stress. Individual AC-SES were deployed inside the flow loop and expanded at 8 bar to ensure complete apposition to the tubing wall. The system was filled with a 0.01 M PBS/7.5% BSA solution at 37 °C. The loops were loaded into the flow system and exposed to controlled coronary artery-like flow (pulsatile, 15 dyn/cm2 ) at 37 °C for 4 h, 1, 3, 7 and 14 days. Immediately following the specified run time, the loops were removed, emptied, flushed with PBS to remove non-adherent debris and stored for subsequent imaging. AC-SES samples were kept in the tube and immersed in PBS, then photographed macroscopically under a stereoscope employing dark field illumination to visualize the coating. 2.6. Porcine coronary artery implants Porcine coronary artery implants and subsequent SEM, histopathology and histomorphometry analyses were performed at CBSET, Inc. (Lexington, MA) using laboratory standard operating procedures. For histopathology and histomorphometry, Yucatan mini-swine were implanted with AC-SES and/or Vision® bare metal stents (BMS, Abbott Vascular, Santa Clara, CA) for 3, 30 or 90 days. Stents were deployed in porcine coronary arteries at a balloon:artery ratio of approximately 1.13:1 in either a single stent configuration or in an overlapping stent configuration using same-stent pairs (AC-SES or BMS) overlapped by approximately 50%. Eight single stents or stent pairs were used for each stent type and time point. For pharmacokinetic analysis, Yucatan mini-swine were implanted with AC-SES for 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 180 days (a minimum of six stents per time point). One AC-SES was deployed in one porcine coronary artery per pig at a balloon:artery ratio of approximately 1.15:1. 2.7. Histology and morphometry At the termination of the in-life portion of the study, porcine hearts were perfusion fixed at 100 mm Hg. Fixed, stented vessels were dissected from the myocardium, sectioned and stained with hematoxylin and eosin as well as Verhoeff's tissue elastin stain. Light microscopy was used to score the tissue for histopathological variables as described in Supplemental Materials. Scoring was performed by a pathologist (co-author J.R.L.S.) in a blinded fashion. Inflammation and injury were scored on a per strut basis and the average was calculated per plane and per stent. Quantitative morphometric analysis was performed on the histological sections from each stented artery using standard light microscopy and computer-assisted image measurement systems (Olympus MicroSuite Biological Suite). Lumen area, IEL bounded area, stent area and EEL bounded area were all measured directly. From these measurements, all other morphometric parameters were calculated. 2.8. Pharmacokinetic analysis Hearts were removed and the stented vessels were dissected from the myocardium including vessel proximal and distal to the stented segment. The stent was cut longitudinally and tissue was removed from the stent. Drug content was assessed separately from the stent and the tissue surrounding the stent. During manual separation of the stent from the arterial tissue, tissue embedded coating deposits were retained with the tissue fraction and account for additive drug in the measured tissue concentrations seen during analysis of drug content. Blood levels were also measured from a separate set of pigs and include additional time points minutes to hours after implantation. Concentration of drug in tissue, blood and on stents was determined using a validated HPLC-MS/MS method using an Agilent 1200 LC system paired to Applied Biosystems API5500 MS with Analyst 1.5 software. 2.9. Data acquisition and analysis Data are presented as mean± standard error. For selected continuous data, if the assumptions of normality and homogeneity of variance were met, treatment differences were assessed by group t-test. If normality or homogeneity of variance were not met, treatment differences were assessed by Mann–Whitney Rank Sum test. For multiple comparisons, treatment differences were assessed by a Kruskal– Wallis One Way Analysis of Variance on Ranks. For all statistical tests, the null hypothesis of no difference was only rejected if the value of the calculated statistic was less than 0.05 (pb0.05). 2.10. Computational studies We developed a 2D computational pharmacokinetics model to evaluate the influence of coating deployment on drug distribution patterns relative to a representative pair of rectangular struts (Fig. 1). Strut dimensions (60×80 μm) and inter-strut separation (1.35 mm) were based on AC-SES dimensions and the initial polymer coating idealized as 5-μm thick conformal layer. Motivated by morphometry micrographs (Fig. 5), coating deployment was modeled as a vertical and horizontal migration of coating segments. Drug elution was implemented as a prescribed constant flux at the interfaces between coating and tissue (based on early in vivo release kinetics). Drug transport in the tissue was assumed to be governed by a constant isotropic diffusion coefficient and bimolecular binding [13] to nonspecific tissue sites and to intracellular FKBP12 [14], using published parameter estimates (Table S1, online supplement). Luminal and periadventitial washout were accounted for by applying perfect sink boundary conditions at these interfaces [9,15]. In accordance with the periodicity of the stent geometry, proximal (inlet) and distal (outlet) boundaries of the computational geometry were treated as perfect insulators (e.g. symmetry boundary conditions). Model equations were solved numerically using the commercial finite element package COMSOL 3.5a. Computational domains corresponding to a range of coating migration scenarios were meshed using 12,000– 20,000 triangular Lagrange quadratic elements (90,000–170,000 degrees of freedom). The resulting system of algebraic equations were solved with a direct linear solver and integrated using a fifth order backward differencing scheme with variable time stepping and tight tolerances (relative tolerance of 10−10 and absolute tolerance of 10−12). A preliminary mesh refinement study confirmed mesh independence of the numerical solution for the utilized mesh density. While modeling provides important insights into the kinetics of drug dissociating from the stent it does not directly quantify how much of the drug released is free relative to that still embedded in coating deposits. 3. Results 3.1. Stent coating and stability The electrostatic coating process results in the deposition of dry powder, crystalline sirolimus onto the stent surface. This is a solvent-free coating process further differentiated by the use of supercritical fluid technology to apply the polymer component [16]. The average crystal particle size of the drug deposited on the stent surface is 2.7 μm with all particles between 1.0 and 10 μm. Because the drug is never dissolved in solvent the crystal structure is maintained during application of the coating. Drug and polymer are layered onto the stent and each layer is sintered to fuse the coating into a smooth, conformal, well-adhered film (Fig. 2). Maintaining the crystalline structure of sirolimus within the coating conferred enhanced drug stability. When coated stents were incubated in serum-supplemented cell culture medium at 37 °C, a reduced percentage of degradants relative to parent drug were found in the stent coatings containing crystalline sirolimus compared to a standard stent coating containing approximately the same amount of sirolimus but in amorphous form. The levels of the major sirolimus degradant two weeks after incubation under simulated use conditions rose from a baseline value of 0.1%±0.06% to 11.0%±1.0% in stents coated with  amorphous sirolimus. In stents with coatings incorporating crystalline sirolimus the increase in degradant was much reduced. Here the relative amount of degradant increased from 0.5%±0.5% to 3.2%±1.8%). This 3.4 fold lower value of relative degradant after two weeks of incubation represents a statistically significant reduction in sirolimus degradation (pb0.05). 3.2. Coating dispersion and drug delivery Absorbable coatings behave differently compared to strut-adherent durable polymer coatings. The structure of the absorbable coating enables the polymer material to soften and spread after implantation. Fig. 3 shows results from flow loop studies performed to visualize coating changes in the AC-SES under simulated implant conditions employing pulsatile flow. In this study, changes in coating morphology were evaluated up to 14 days and the coating was found to become swollen and to gradually spread away from the stent strut in a uniform manner. No evidence of delamination was found to occur. The flow loop studies involved a simplified, cell-free preparation where serial visualization of changes in coating morphology is possible. In the flow loop studies, the stent is deployed against the wall of a flexible polymer tube and fluid is pumped through the tubing to hydrate the coating. These studies differ from in vivo implantation into a coronary artery, because in the in vivo situation the stent coating is in direct contact with tissue. As the coating degrades and becomes more porous, cells within the neointima can intercalate into the coating and cause the coating to separate from the stent struts. Most polymer materials, including PLGA, are labile and susceptible to dissolution in the fluids used for histological processing of stented tissue sections. The location, size and shape of the polymer coating in histology sections is witnessed rather as the “negative image” of a space occupying mass. Fig. 4 illustrates this phenomenon and provides evidence of coating spread or deposition in the intima 30 days after AC-SES implantation into porcine coronary arteries. The spreadable coating reduces the load of drug immediately around the stent strut and extends polymer/drug coating from the strut. The coating deposits contain drug still locked in a crystalline lattice combined with the softened PLGA polymer. Thus, the area of drug delivery is increased beyond the immediate vicinity of the stent strut. Modeling of this phenomenon demonstrates that at small migration distances deposition is enhanced due to greater surface area of elution. Above some threshold distance, deposition is also enhanced by saturation of binding sites that are otherwise free in the strut-adherent case (Fig. 5). 3.3. Rapid coating absorption By 90 days after implantation there is no further evidence of coating deposits suggesting near complete absorption of coating by that point (Fig. 6). Following implantation of any stent coated with an absorbable polymer, the thickness of the strut and its associated coating will vary over time as the polymer absorbs. After 90 days, the absence of stent coating leaves the struts (represented as “S” and seen as the square shaped clear space) at their bare metal dimensions. 3.4. Controlled and consistent drug release When drug is locked in a crystalline lattice within the stent coating it must dissociate from the crystal before diffusion through the polymer and elution from the coating can commence. When drug solubilization is rate-limiting, the rate of drug elution will remain relatively constant over time exhibiting release kinetics that are far less concentration gradient-dependent than classic diffusion-based drug delivery systems. Published theoretical analyses [17] predict that dissolution controlled release of crystalline drugs should display zero order kinetics elution after a negligibly small initial burst. Indeed the AC-SES displays a virtual absence of an initial burst of drug release (Fig. 7). The stent containing crystalline sirolimus releases its drug in a near linear fashion over several weeks. Within 45–60 days the stent is essentially free of sirolimus (less than 3% remains at the 45 day time point). 3.5. Drug transfer to tissue In vivo release of drug from the stent is complete within 45– 60 days after implantation into porcine coronary arteries (Fig. 7, open circles). The average release rate amounts to ~3 μg/day of sirolimus from a 3.0× 15 mm stent. Control over sirolimus release results in efficient drug transfer to and deposition within the arterial tissue (Fig. 7, closed circles). Early after implant the coating is still firmly attached to the stent as demonstrated in the flow loop studies. During this time, the vast majority of drug remains in the coating adhered to the stent. Some drug is seen in tissue and likely consists largely of free drug released from the coating. As time goes on, drug still trapped in coating that has dissociated from the stent (Fig. 4) will represent an increasing fraction of the measured amount of drug in tissue. We hypothesize that by day 30 polymer degradation progresses to the point where coating adhesion begins to appreciably decline so that a much greater percentage of coating can detach from the stent and disperse into tissue where it is quantified as “arterial drug concentration.” Between 45–60 days, all the coating is released from the stent. From that point on, the tissue levels will fall as drug is slowly cleared from the site and there is no residual sirolimus left on the stent to supply additional drug. 3.6. Biocompatibility throughout the period of polymer absorption Despite the sustained presence of sirolimus after implantation of the AC-SES in porcine coronary arteries, endothelialization was not  different from the control BMS and was complete by 30 days after implantation (Table 1). Implantation of this unique stent system coated with crystalline sirolimus and PLGA into porcine coronary arteries generated a benign tissue response characterized by the expected increase in fibrin deposition and some minimal mineralization (Figs. 4 and 6). The porcine coronary artery implant model used was a safety model involving minimal overstretch. This non-overstretch model typically shows little neointimal hyperplasia except in the presence of additional stimuli such as pro-inflammatory stent coatings. Following single stent placement in this model, the AC‐SES resulted in a tissue response similar to that seen following placement of the control BMS. When this model is challenged, however, with placement of two overlapping stents, then even bare metal stent implantation will trigger an increased tissue response [18,19]. Implantation of overlapping AC‐SES resulted in reduced inflammation and neointimal hyperplasia compared to implantation of overlapping bare metal control stents at 30 and 90 days after implantation (Figs. 8 and 9, Table 1). 4. Discussion The principal advantage of an absorbable stent coating has been viewed as its temporary residence time such that any inflammatory potential brought about by its presence is of limited duration. We show here that additional benefit can be derived from the ability of the absorbable coating to soften, spread and migrate into surrounding tissue. This deployment of the coating provides more uniform drug distribution and the ability to saturate binding sites farther from the stent struts. Drug therapy is mediated by this binding to target receptors and it is the amount of drug bound to these receptors at any given time that dictates drug effectiveness, not the total amount of drug present either on the stent or in the artery. As vessel injury from balloon delivery of the stent occurs all along the vessel wall, anti-restenotic therapy is optimized by receptor binding both at and between stent struts. Equally important to the expanded area of drug delivery is the consequent reduction in peak drug concentrations in the immediate vicinity of the stent struts. High concentrations of drug may result in focal regions of tissue toxicity and vessel thrombogenicity [20]. The crystalline nature of the drug load in the AC-SES coating provides additional control over drug delivery. The drug locked in crystalline particles does not diffuse within the coating and after implantation of the AC-SES far less drug is available for immediate release. This eliminates the burst of drug release seen otherwise with most commercially available strut-adherent matrix DES products. The burst seen with other products within minutes to hours after stent implantation is equivalent to delivery of a large bolus of drug that is more than the artery can retain [21] and much of the excess drug is washed away in the systemic circulation. In contrast, systemic sirolimus levels in the porcine coronary implant model following implantation of the AC-SES containing crystalline sirolimus remain below the level of quantification (b0.1 ng/ml) at all times [22]. Release of a large burst of drug soon after stent implantation at a time when there is little or no neointima separating the stent from the endothelium may cause additional endothelial damage and dysfunction [23]. Drug that is part of a crystalline structure must overcome a high activation energy barrier to dissociate from that crystal before it can diffuse away from the coating. This means that the dissociation/dissolution reaction becomes the rate-limiting step in drug delivery rather than the diffusion of drug from the stent [24]. With dissociation from the crystalline lattice controlling the rate of drug release, a more consistent rate of remaining in the coating. The slow, consistent release of drug from the AC-SES sustains drug release for an extended period. This allows for delivery of drug throughout the period of polymer absorption. As sirolimus is both an anti-inflammatory agent [25,26] as well as an anti-proliferative drug, its presence can counteract any tissue reaction from generation of polymer degradation products during the period of polymer absorption. Ideally, sirolimus should be delivered from the DES at a consistently therapeutic dose that is sufficient to limit intimal hyperplasia without delaying the re-endothelialization of the vessel critical to healing. The AC-SES appears to accomplish this goal as endothelialization after implantation was not different from that of a BMS. By balancing drug delivery with the relatively rapid absorption of the polymer within a 90-day period the AC-SES optimizes therapy and allows for healing without concerns of late vascular events due to lingering effects of stent coating. The use of this rapidly absorbable PLGA formulation adds a new dimension to coated stents, the potential for a deployable coating. The time-dependent changes in PLGA stent-coating morphology and integrity have recently been described [27] based on in vitro and in vivo degradation studies analyzed by a variety of techniques including light microscopy, gel permeation chromatography, weight loss, fieldemission environmental scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and standard SEM. After implantation, any bioabsorbable polymer absorbs moisture from the surrounding tissue and begins to swell. Hydration leads eventually to polymer degradation by the process of hydrolytic cleavage of the ester bonds. Polymer molecular weight decreases relatively rapidly as bonds are broken, mass loss occurs more slowly. These data demonstrate a homogenous degradation process in which the coating maintains its integrity and strong adhesion to the strut during the entire degradation process. Implantation of the AC-SES in a flow loop resulted in a similar finding of PLGA swelling and spread. In these studies no delamination was observed; however it is important to note that the in vivo degradation studies performed by Xi et al. utilized a PMMA chamber to exclude cells from making contact with the coated stent after subcutaneous implantation. Direct contact with cells such as occurs after coronary artery implantation will lead eventually to cell infiltration into the degrading coating and this will serve to separate the coating from the stent struts. Similar to the benefit derived from a more uniform tissue distribution of sirolimus, spreading of polymer in the tissue may facilitate absorption and dilute the local accumulation of degradation products. Coating dispersion will only be useful from a drug delivery perspective if the time course of morphological changes is matched by the time course of drug delivery. Other known stents coated with absorbable polymers have a relatively prolonged degradation such that movement of the polymer is likely to occur only after several months [28]. At the same time, as described above, the drug within these coatings is in an amorphous form that is released from the stent relatively quickly, often losing much of the drug load in a burst within minutes to hours after implantation. In these cases, by the time the polymer coating disperses into the tissue, there is no longer sufficient drug remaining in the coating to provide enhanced drug delivery. In conclusion several aspects of the AC-SES lend themselves to improved drug delivery. The inclusion of crystalline rather than amorphous drug in the coating results in consistent drug release kinetics that lack an initial burst. A deployable polymer coating reduces the vicissitudes in drug levels and broadens that area of arterial wall with binding site occupancy. The polymer coating absorbs rapidly leaving a bare metal stent with fewer concerns about long-term biocompatibility	Wenda C. Carlyle a, ⁎, James B. McClain a , Abraham R.

25	2014	Design and physicochemical characterisation of novel dissolving polymeric microneedle arrays for transdermal delivery of high dose, low molecular weight drugs	We describe formulation and evaluation of novel dissolving polymeric microneedle (MN) arrays for the facilitated delivery of low molecular weight, high dose drugs. Ibuprofen sodium was used as the model here and was successfully formulated at approximately 50% w/w in the dry state using the copolymer poly(methylvinylether/maleic acid). These MNs were robust and effectively penetrated skin in vitro, dissolving rapidly to deliver the incorporated drug. The delivery of 1.5 mg ibuprofen sodium, the theoretical mass of ibuprofen sodium contained within the dry MN alone, was vastly exceeded, indicating extensive delivery of the drug loaded into the baseplates. Indeed in in vitro transdermal delivery studies, approximately 33 mg (90%) of the drug initially loaded into the arrays was delivered over 24 h. Iontophoresis produced no meaningful increase in delivery. Biocompatibility studies and in vivo rat skin tolerance experiments raised no concerns. The blood plasma ibuprofen sodium concentrations achieved in rats (263 μg ml−1 at the 24 h time point) were approximately 20 times greater than the human therapeutic plasma level. By simplistic extrapolation of average weights from rats to humans, a MN patch design of no greater than 10 cm2 could cautiously be estimated to deliver therapeutically-relevant concentrations of ibuprofen sodium in humans. This work, therefore, represents a significant progression in exploitation of MN for successful transdermal delivery of a much wider range of drugs. 1. Introduction Microneedle (MN) arrays are micron scale, minimally-invasive devices that painlessly by-pass the skin's stratum corneum (SC), which is the principal barrier to topically-applied drugs. MN arrays have been extensively investigated in recent years as a means to enhance transdermal drug and vaccine delivery. The current trend in MN-based research has involved recognition of the dubious biocompatibility of silicon and the potential for inappropriate reuse of silicon or metal microneedles, which remain fully intact after removal from a patient's skin. Consequently, much recent effort has focussed on MN arrays prepared from drug-loaded gels of FDA-approved biocompatible polymers. Such systems typically dissolve in skin interstitial fluid to release their drug payload. Dissolving MN arrays have been shown to enhance transdermal and intradermal delivery of numerous substances, including insulin [1,2], 5-aminolevulinic acid [3], sulforhodamine B [4], low molecular weight heparin [5], ovalbumin [6,7], adenovirus vector [7] and a variety of vaccine antigens [8,9]. Synergistic effects of dissolving MN arrays used in combination with other enhancing strategies have been reported recently by Garland et al. [10], where the use of drug-loaded dissolving poly(methyl-vinyl-ether-co-maleic-acid) MN arrays was coupled with iontophoresis. A schematic depiction of the means by which dissolving MN arrays deliver their payload is presented in Fig. 1(A). The compounds delivered to date by dissolving MNs have typically been of high potency, meaning only a low dose is required to achieve a therapeutic affect (e.g. insulin) [11] or elicit the required immune response [8,9]. Accordingly, dissolving MN arrays have proven to be an extremely successful delivery strategy, even though high molecular weight biomolecules are only normally delivered from the dissolving MNs themselves and not the baseplate upon which they are formed [11]. Clearly, the majority of marketed drug substances are not low dose high potency biomolecules. Indeed, many drugs require oral doses of several hundred milligrams  per day in order to achieve therapeutic plasma concentrations in humans. Until now, such high doses could not be delivered transdermally from a patch of reasonable size, even for molecules whose physicochemical properties are ideal for passive diffusion across the skin's stratum corneum barrier. Therefore, transdermal delivery has traditionally been limited to fairly lipophilic low molecular weight, high potency drug substances. Since most drug substances do not possess these properties, the transdermal delivery market has not expanded beyond around 20 drugs [12–14]. In the present study, we aimed to overcome the current limitations of both conventional transdermal delivery and dissolving MN strategies to deliver, for the first time, therapeutically-relevant doses of a model low molecular weight, high dose drug molecule. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Chemicals Polyethylene glycol (PEG, MW 10,000 Da), ibuprofen sodium, poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA, MW 31,000–50,000 g/mol), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, MW 40,000 g/mol), alginic acid sodium salt and the 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) cell viability reagent were purchased from Sigma Aldrich, Dorset, UK. Eudragit® S (MW 125,000 g/mol) and Eudragit® L (MW 125,000 g/mol) were obtained from Rohm GmbH & Co.KG, Pharma Polymers, Darmstadt, Germany. Poly(lactic acid) (PLA) was purchased from Futerro, Escanaffles, Belgium. Isocratic HPLC grade methanol and acetonitrile were purchased from VWR International, East Grinstead, UK. L-132 lung epithelial cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and EpiSkin™ was purchased from Skin Ethic Laboratories, Lyon, France. The human IL-1α ELISA kit and Bradford assay kit were purchased from Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA. Gantrez® AN-139, a co-polymer of methyl vinyl ether and maleic anhydride (PMVE/MAH, MW 1,080,000 Da) and Gantrez® MS-955, a mixed sodium and calcium salt of methyl vinyl ether and maleic anhydride copolymer (PVM/MA, MW 1,000,000 Da) were gifts from Ashland, Kidderminster, UK. All other chemicals used were of analytical reagent grade. 2.2. Microneedle array fabrication Laser-engineered silicone micromould templates were used in micromoulding of MN arrays and were microfabricated using a previously-reported approach [15]. The arrays were composed of 361 (19 × 19) needles perpendicular to the base, of conical shape and 600 μm in height, with base width of 300 μm and interspacing of 50 μm. The array area was approximately 0.49 cm2 . In order to test the compatibility and suitability of a number of different polymers as potential matrices in the formation of polymeric MN arrays with high loadings of incorporated ibuprofen sodium, various aqueous gel formulations were prepared, as summarised in Table 1. Approximately 300 mg of the relevant polymer gel/drug preparation was poured into the silicone moulds and these were centrifuged for 15 min at 550 ×g. Following centrifugation, the MN arrays were dried in the moulds at room temperature for 48 h. The MN arrays were then carefully removed from the moulds and assessed visually for mechanical strength and formulation homogeneity. 2.3. Fabrication of PMVE/MA microneedle arrays incorporating ibuprofen sodium After numerous iterations, MN arrays prepared using the free acid co-polymer poly(methylvinyl ether/maleic acid) (PMVE/MA), produced by aqueous hydrolysis of the PMVE/MAH supplied as described previously [11,15,16], were found to have superior properties to other compositions (Fig. 1B). To prepare such arrays, relevant masses of ibuprofen sodium and a 30% w/w PMVE/MA gel, the pH of which had been altered to 7.0 using sodium hydroxide (NaOH) pellets, were added together so as to generate a formulation of polymer gel:drug in the ratio 70%:30%. This formulation was then poured into the silicone micromoulds, centrifuged for 15 min at 550 ×g and again allowed to dry under ambient conditions for 48 h. 2.4. Rheological characterisation of PMVE/MA gels containing ibuprofen sodium In order to consider the processability of gels with such high drug loadings, continuous flow rheological assessment of the gels was performed using a TA Instruments AR 1500 Rheometer (TA Instruments, Elstree, Herts, UK) fitted with a 40 mm diameter steel parallel plate. Flow rheology was conducted at 25 °C in continuous ramp mode with the shear rate increased from 0 to 50 1/s. Viscosity was determined by application of the Power law. 2.5. Determination of water content of PMVE/MA microneedles incorporating ibuprofen sodium The percentage water content of the ibuprofen sodium-loaded PMVE/MA MN arrays was determined with a Q500 Thermo Gravimetric Analyser (TA Instruments, Elstree, Herts, UK). Samples of 5.0–10.0 mg were heated from ambient temperature to 600 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 . Nitrogen flow rates of 40 ml min−1 (balance purge gas) and 60 ml min−1 (sample purge gas) were maintained for all samples. The data from thermogravimetric analysis experiments was analysed with TA Instruments Universal Analysis 2000 software, version 4.4A (TA Instruments, Elstree, Herts, UK). 2.6. Mechanical testing of microneedle arrays MN arrays were subjected to mechanical tests for compression and skin insertion. The mechanical properties were evaluated using a TA-XT2 Texture Analyser (Stable Microsystems, Haslemere, UK) in compression mode, as described previously [15] (Fig. 1C). MN arrays were visualised before and after application of the compression load using a  was placed, dermis side down, on a 500 μm-thick sheet of dental wax (Anutex®, Kemdent Works, Swindon, UK) topped with Parafilm® (Alpha Laboratories, Hampshire, UK) and this assembly was then secured on a wooden block for support. Using double-sided adhesive tape, MN arrays were carefully attached to the moveable cylindrical probe. The probe was lowered onto the skin at a speed of 0.5 mm s−1 until the required force was exerted. Forces were held for 30 s with known forces of 0.4 and 0.5 N per needle. Once the target force was reached, the probe was moved upwards at a speed of 0.5 mm s−1 . After removal of MN arrays, the skin was viewed under the digital microscope. The surface of the stained skin was then photographed using the digital camera and the number of microconduits was determined visually. 2.7. Determination of ibuprofen sodium recovery from MN arrays In order to determine the percentage recovery of ibuprofen sodium from dissolving MN arrays, the arrays were dissolved in 100 ml PBS (pH 7.4) in a volumetric flask and two 10-fold dilutions were subsequently carried out in PBS. The drug content of each MN array was determined by HPLC as described below and the percentage recovery of ibuprofen sodium was then determined. 2.8. Microneedle in-skin dissolution kinetics The dissolution rate of the ibuprofen sodium-loaded PMVE/MA MN arrays was investigated in dermatomed neonatal porcine skin. The skin samples were carefully shaved using a disposable razor and then equilibrated in PBS (pH 7.4) for 15 min. A circular specimen of the skin was then dried and carefully secured to the donor compartment of a modified Franz diffusion cell (FDC-400 flat flange, 15 mm orifice diameter, mounted on an FDCD diffusion drive console providing synchronous stirring at 600 rpm and thermostated at 37 ± 1 °C, Crown Glass Co. Inc., Sommerville, NJ, USA) using cynoacrylate glue (Loctite Ltd, Dublin, Ireland) with the stratum corneum accessible via the top of the donor compartment. This was then placed on a piece of dental wax to support the skin and MN arrays were inserted into the centre of the skin section using a custom-made applicator device (11.0 N force) [15]. To ensure the MN arrays remained within the skin, a circular steel weight (diameter 11.0 mm, 5.0 g mass) was placed on top of the MN arrays. With the arrays in place, donor compartments were mounted onto the receptor compartments of the Franz cells. At the indicated time points, the arrays were removed from the skin, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −20 °C until viewing. MN arrays were viewed using a Leica MZ6 dissection microscope (Leica Microsystems (UK) Ltd., Milton Keynes, UK) fitted with a Nikon Coolpix 950 digital camera (Nikon UK Limited, Surrey, UK). 2.9. In vitro drug delivery studies Diffusion of ibuprofen sodium released from dissolving PMVE/MA MN arrays across dermatomed (350 μm) neonatal porcine skin was investigated in vitro using the modified Franz diffusion cells, as described previously [11] (Fig. 1D). The MN array was placed on top of the skin and again inserted using the custom-made applicator (11 N). A piece of occlusive dressing (Scotchpak™ 9732, 3 M, Carrickmines, Ireland, coated with a 1.0 mm layer of DuroTak™ 34-416A, National Starch & Chemical Company, Bridgewater, NJ, USA), identical to that used in the in vivo studies described below, was used to secure the MN arrays in place. The cylindrical 5.0 g stainless steel weight was again placed on top of the occluded array and the donor compartment of the apparatus was clamped onto the receiver compartment. The donor compartment and sampling arm were sealed using Parafilm®. The receiver compartment contained PBS (pH 7.4) degassed prior to use and thermostated to 37 ± 1 °C. Syringes (1.0 ml) with 8.0 cm needles were used to remove 200 μl of the Franz cell contents at appropriate time points and 200 μl of pre-warmed PBS was subsequently added to replace this. Samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 14,000 ×g using an Eppendorf Minispin centrifuge (Eppendorf UK Limited, Stevenage, UK) and appropriately diluted in PBS prior to HPLC analysis. In in vitro studies exploring the combinatorial approach of iontophoresis and dissolving MN arrays, a silver wire (acting as the anode) was placed into the receiver medium via the side arm of the Franz cell and a silver–silver chloride electrode (acting as the cathode) was placed on top of the dissolving MN array. A commercially available power supply (Phoresor II, Iomed, Salt Lake City, FL, USA) was used to deliver a current of 0.5 mA cm−2 over a 6 h period. Sampling and analysis were performed as described above. 2.10. Biocompatibility studies Since both polymer and drug are deposited in skin by dissolving MN, their influence on cellular viability and irritancy are of great interest. Initial studies here were in vitro, with both 2D and 3D cell culture models employed. Human L-132 lung cells, engaged as an epithelial cell model in this study, were routinely maintained in Minimum Essential Medium (MEM, Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS). Cells were cultured in tissue culture plasticware (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and housed in a humidified incubator at 37 °C, with a CO2 content of 5% (Fig. 1F). Sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) was used as a positive control, as it has long been recognised as a human skin irritant [20] and has been demonstrated to induce the production and release of the irritancy biomarker, interleukin-1α [IL-1α] [21,24]. All test compounds (ibuprofen sodium, PMVE/MA, ibuprofen sodium-loaded PMVE/MA MN arrays) were dissolved in cell culture medium and were filter-sterilised using a 0.2 μm filter prior to their addition to the cells. The negative control was cell culture medium alone. During cell viability and IL-1α expression analysis experiments, L-132 cells, at a density of 105 cells/well, were transferred to 24-well tissue culture plates, in a total volume each of 500 μl. The cells were incubated in these conditions overnight, allowing the cells to achieve confluence. The following day, the 500 μl cell culture medium was removed and replaced with 300 μl of fresh medium containing test agent at the appropriate concentration. The cells were then returned to the incubator for 24 h. EpiSkin™ 3D skin constructs were treated as recommended by the manufacturer (Fig. 1E). EpiSkin™ was exposed to the test compounds for 60 min. This exposure time was decided upon following communications with the manufacturer — 15 min exposure of EpiSkin™ was recommended for ‘raw materials’, with longer exposure times of 60 min recommended for ‘finished products’. To assess cell viability, the cell monolayers were washed with 500 μl sterile PBS (pH 7.4) and were then replenished with MEM containing MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) reagent at 1 mg ml−1 . The cells were then returned to the incubator for a final 2 h. The MTT assay is a gold-standard assay for determining cell viability and is based on the ability of viable cells to reduce the water-soluble MTT to a water-insoluble formazan product [22,23]. The cell supernatants, following 2 h incubation of the cells in the MTT containing medium, were discarded and 500 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was added to each well of the 24 well plate to solubilise the formazan product. The plates were shaken for 2 min to assist solubilisation, before 200 μl aliquots were transferred to duplicate wells of a 96-well microplate for absorbance measurement. The absorbance was measured at 550 nm, with DMSO acting as a background control. To assess the release of IL-1α into the cell culture medium in response to the various test stimuli, the MEM that was reserved in the viability test was used in a commercially available human IL-1α specific ELISA, following the manufacturer's guidelines. Additionally, cellular production (cell-associated IL-1α) of the same cytokine in the absence of cellular secretion was also investigated. The cells were similarly challenged and following treatment, were lysed in PBS (pH 7.4) containing 0.5% (v/v) Triton-X-100 on an upright carousel at 4 °C. Cell lysates were analysed for IL-1α content according to manufacturer's instructions [24]. The total protein content of the cell lysates was also assessed in order to normalise data in the case of cell-associated IL-1α measurement. This was performed using the standard Bradford assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA) for protein concentration determination. IL-1α levels were expressed as pg IL-1α/μg total protein and were then converted to represent the relative IL-1α expression of the cells as a percentage of that expressed by those cells incubated under control conditions. 2.11. In vivo tolerance study Tolerance studies using the PMVE/MA MN arrays were carried out prior to the commencement of in vivo experiments, in order to determine whether the formulation or the occlusive dressing to be used in subsequent experiments caused any irritation to the rats. Four MN arrays or pieces of occlusive dressings alone were applied using gentle finger pressure to the shaved backs of each of 2 rats and secured in place for 24 h with medical tape (Micropore®, 3 M, St. Paul, MN, USA). These were then removed following 24 h and the rats were monitored for any signs of irritation on their skin and any other adverse effects for up to 7 days post removal of the MN and/or occlusive dressing. 2.12. In vivo evaluation All male Sprague dawley rats were acclimatised to laboratory conditions for a 7 day period. To prevent fur from interfering with dermal contact of the patch, animals were anesthetised using gas anaesthesia (2–4% isoflurane in oxygen) 24 h before experimentation, and the hair was removed with an animal hair clipper. Additionally, depilatory cream (Boots Expert®, The Boots Company PLC, Nottingham, UK) was used to remove any residual hair. This was followed by a one day recovery period to facilitate the re-establishment of skin barrier function [11,22]. The following day, the rats were again anaesthetised immediately prior to MN array application. Four dissolving MN arrays, which had each been secured onto an open “frame” of approximately 1.6 cm2 area made from adhesive foam (TG Eakin Ltd, Comber, Co. Down, UK) were applied opposite each other using firm finger pressure onto a pinched section of skin on the back of the rat, as illustrated in Fig. 5A. This orientation of application was used as a means to apply equal pressure to the two opposing arrays. An occlusive dressing was carefully applied over the MN arrays and these were then secured in place by gently wrapping the animal in Micropore® tape, avoiding the legs. The rats were returned to their cages and tail vein bleeds (no more than 200 μl per sample) were collected into heparinised tubes at designated time points: 1, 2, 4, 6 and 24 h. The MN arrays were left in place for 24 h. Plasma was separated from the whole blood samples and prepared as described below, prior to HPLC analysis. Approval for animal experiments was obtained from the Committee of the Biological Research Unit, Queen's University Belfast. The work was carried out under the Project Licence PPL 2678 and the Personal Licence PIL 1466. All in vivo experiments were conducted according to the policy of the federation of European Laboratory Animal Science Associations and the European Convention for the protection of vertebrate animals used for experimental and other scientific purposes, with implementation of the principles of the 3R's (replacement, reduction, refinement). 2.13. Extraction of plasma and drug Control rat blood for assay method development was obtained from healthy Sprague dawley rats. Blood from culled rats was collected via heart puncture with a heparinised syringe into ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)-coated tubes. Plasma separation was performed by centrifuging the blood at 500 ×g for 10 min in a refrigerated centrifuge (4 °C). The plasma was then aliquoted into microtubes and stored at −80 °C until required. Aliquots (10 μl) of ibuprofen sodium working standard solutions were added to 190 μl blank plasma. The sample was vortex mixed for 10 s in a poly(propylene) microtube and 500 μl acetonitrile (ACN) was then added. The sample was vortex mixed for 10 min and centrifuged at 14,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. The ACN extraction procedure was then repeated to ensure optimum extraction of the drug. The sample mixture was placed in a disposable glass culture tube and the extract was dried under a stream of nitrogen at 35 °C for 50 min using a Zymark TurboVap® LV Evaporator Workstation. The residue was then reconstituted in 200 μl PBS (pH 7.4) and collected into a microtube. This was then vortex mixed for 30 s and centrifuged at 14,000 ×g for 10 min at room temperature. The supernatant was transferred into an autosampler vial and 50 μl was injected onto the HPLC column. 2.14. Pharmaceutical analysis of ibuprofen sodium Ibuprofen-sodium quantification in PBS and rat plasma was performed using reversed phase HPLC (Agilent 1200® Binary Pump, Agilent 1200®, Standard Autosampler, Agilent 1200® Variable Wavelength Detector, Agilent Technologies UK Ltd, Stockport, UK) with UV detection at 220 nm. Gradient separation was achieved using an Agilent Eclipse XDB-C18 (5 μm pore size, 4.6 × 150 mm) analytical column fitted with a guard cartridge of matching chemistry. The mobile phase was 60%:40% methanol:10 mM potassium phosphate (pH 4.6), with a flow rate of 1 ml min−1 and a run time of 30 min per sample. The injection volume was 50 μl. The chromatograms obtained were analysed using Agilent ChemStation® Software B.02.01. Least squares linear regression analysis and correlation analysis were performed on the triplicate calibration curves produced on each of three separate days, enabling determination of the equation of the line, its coefficient of determination and the residual sum of squares (RSS). To determine the limit of detection (LoD) and limit of quantification (LoQ), an approach based on the standard deviation of the response and the slope of the representative calibration curve was employed, as described in the guidelines from the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) [19]. Ibuprofen sodium either dissolved in PBS (standards), or samples collected from the Franz cell apparatus (unknowns), was quantified by injection of the sample, following filter sterilisation through 0.2 μm filters, directly onto the HPLC column. In the case of plasma samples, the drug was first extracted from the plasma, as described above, and then the resulting sample, which had been reconstituted in PBS and filtered, was injected onto the column. The method parameters for detection of ibuprofen sodium in PBS and plasma were identical. 2.15. Statistical analysis Where appropriate, data was analysed using the Student's t-test, one-way ANOVA with post-hoc comparisons, or Mann–Whitney U-test. In all cases, p b 0.05 denoted significance. Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, SPSS 18.0 version 2.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA), was used for all analyses. 3. Results 3.1. MN array fabrication In this study, a range of commonly employed film-forming FDAapproved pharma polymers were investigated for their suitability in the preparation of a novel dissolving MN system loaded with high doses of ibuprofen-sodium. The MNs prepared have been summarised in Table 1, with brief accompanying comments relating to their identified properties. Some of the polymers tested in  this study, used in various combinations and in various different drug loading ratios, were: Eudragit®L, Eudragit®S, poly(lactic acid) (PLA), poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP), Gantrez® MS-955 and alginic acid. For a variety of reasons, outlined in Table 1, the vast majority of the polymers investigated were not suitable for use in production of the intended drug-containing MN arrays. The co-polymer which showed the most promise and potential was the copolymer, poly(methyl vinyl ether/maleic acid) (PMVE/MA), prepared by aqueous hydrolysis of the parent anhydride Gantrez® AN-139. Drug-loaded MN arrays were then formulated using a range of PMVE/MA stock concentrations at either pH 2.0 or pH 7.0, in combination with a range of different ibuprofen sodium loadings, ranging between 5 and 50% w/w. The formulation that produced the MN arrays with the most desirable characteristics, in terms of mechanical properties, as well as the highest achievable drug loading was fabricated in a ratio of 70% PMVE/MA 30% w/w gel, pH 7.0:30% ibuprofen sodium. Fig. 1B is a representative digital photograph of a dissolving MN array in a 19 × 19 format, therefore totalling 361 individual MN projections per array, each with height of 600 μm, base width of 300 μm and interspacing of 50 μm on an array area of approximately 0.49 cm2 . These MN arrays were prepared using approximately 300 mg of the gel. Upon drying, approximately 40% of this mass was lost due to evaporation of the water contained within, resulting in arrays containing approximately 50% w/w active agent. 3.2. Rheological characterisation The rheological and mechanical properties of the gel formed when the candidate polymer, PMVE/MA was mixed with ibuprofen sodium (70% PMVE/MA 30% w/w, pH 7.0:30% ibuprofen sodium) were deduced. The viscosity of a polymer solution depends on concentration, size (i.e. molecular weight) of the dissolved polymer, pH, temperature, ionic strength and additives at a given shear rate. The viscosity of 30% w/w PMVE/MA, pH 7.0 decreased significantly (p b 0.001) after the addition of the ibuprofen sodium. This was possibly due to dampening of electrostatic repulsion between the ionisable free acid groups caused by the presence of the additional sodium content of the gels formed (Fig. 2A). 3.3. Mechanical testing of MN arrays The Texture Analyser was used to determine the mechanical strength of the ibuprofen sodium-containing PMVE/MA MN arrays. As applied force was increased, there was a progressive decrease in MN height but, notably, none of the MN fractured, rather they became somewhat compressed (Fig. 2B). In general, increasing the forces applied per needle resulted in an increase in the penetration efficiency of the arrays, as shown in Fig. 2D. The percentage of microconduits successfully created in the skin at insertion forces of 0.40 and 0.50 N/needle were approximately 90% and 100%, respectively. In both cases, microconduits could also be traced on the surface of the laboratory film (Parafilm®) placed underneath the dermatomed neonatal porcine skin, Fig. 2D (ii) and (iv). 3.4. Water content determination and ibuprofen sodium content The bound and free water of the ibuprofen sodium-containing PMVE/MA MN arrays, as determined using thermogravimetric analysis, were 7.22 ± 0.64% and 3.50 ± 0.53%, respectively (means ± S.D., n = 3). The percentage recovery of ibuprofen sodium from MN arrays which were dissolved post-casting in a known volume of PBS (pH 7.4) was 99.6 ± 0.46% (means ± S.D., n = 6) (Fig. 3A). 3.5. In-skin dissolution studies Dissolution of the needles was evident after as little as 30 s and the needles had completely disappeared after 5 min. An additional dissolution study was carried out in which dissolving MN arrays were placed into flasks containing 20 ml PBS (pH 7.4). The dissolution time for MN arrays was 4.39 ± 0.88 min. These experiments indicate the rapidity of MN dissolution using this drug delivery system. 3.6. Pharmaceutical analysis of ibuprofen sodium HPLC methods for the quantification of ibuprofen-sodium, in either PBS or plasma, were validated according to ICH guidelines. Limits of quantification and detection were determined and are presented in Table 2(i) and (ii), respectively. 3.7. In vitro drug delivery from ibuprofen sodium-loaded dissolving PMVE/MA MN arrays Ibuprofen sodium was detected in the receiver compartment of the Franz cells by HPLC analysis 15 min following application of MN arrays and the concentration of drug in the cells increased in a time-dependent manner until the end of the release experiment (24 h) (Fig. 3B). MN arrays delivered a total of 33.5 ± 6 mg of ibuprofen sodium in 24 h. The MN arrays contained an average total of 37.24 ± 2.25 mg ibuprofen sodium, meaning that approximately 90% of the contained drug loading was delivered across the dermatomed neonatal porcine skin in 24 h. 3.8. Cathodal iontophoresis Cathodal iontophoresis coupled with the utilisation of the dissolving MN delivery system may result in increased rates of skin permeation. This was investigated here and Fig. 3C illustrates the permeation profiles of ibuprofen sodium following cathodal iontophoresis (IP), at a current density and duration of 0.5 mA cm−2 and 6 h, respectively. The combination of cathodal IP with this dissolving MN delivery system led to an enhancement in ibuprofen sodium permeation across the dermatomed neonatal porcine skin over a 6 h sampling period, in comparison to the dissolving MN array used in isolation. This difference was not significant, however (p N 0.05) as 26.65 ± 0.43 mg of drug was delivered in the case of MN arrays used in isolation, as compared to 31.98 ± 0.78 mg of drug delivered when MN arrays and IP were used in combination. The in vitro permeation of ibuprofen sodium using the combinatorial approach of dissolving MN arrays and cathodal IP was then followed for a shorter period of 30 min only (Fig. 3D). The quantity of ibuprofen sodium which was successfully delivered using the combination of dissolving MN arrays and cathodal IP was significantly higher (p b 0.05) than that achieved with MN arrays only at 1, 5 and 10 min. Following these initial sampling time points, there was no significant difference between the quantities of drug delivered at subsequent   were deemed to be significant (p b 0.0001). A positive control of 0.1% w/v SDS unsurprisingly also led to a significant (p b 0.0001) reduction in cell viability. Treatment of L-132 fibroblasts for 24 h with a 0.01% w/v solution of SDS in MEM resulted in a four-fold increase in the amount of cellassociated IL-1α (Fig. 4B). Exposure of the cells to 0.116 mg ml−1 ibuprofen sodium or PMVE/MA led to marginal, but not significant, increases in IL-1α expression. Increasing the concentration of the MN formulation to 0.232 mg ml−1 led to an increase in the expression of the inflammatory marker, but this was not significant (p N 0.05). Treatment with 2.5 mg ml−1 ibuprofen sodium and 5 mg ml−1 MN formulation had resulted in almost total loss of L-132 viability (Fig. 4A). Accordingly, these solutions led to undetectable cellassociated IL-1α levels in the cell lysates (Fig. 4B). No IL-1α was detectable in the culture medium itself following treatment, indicating that the IL-1α was not secreted by the cells. The data indicates that the drug and co-polymer, used in isolation or in combination at the indicated concentrations, were not irritant to the cells. Treatment of EpiSkin, reconstructed human epidermis, with 5% w/v SDS (the recommended positive control) for 60 min followed by a 42 h recovery period, resulted in an 80% loss of tissue viability (p b 0.0001) (Fig. 4C). Similar treatments with ibuprofen sodium, PMVE/MA (both 0.116 mg ml−1 ) or MN formulation (0.232 mg ml−1 ) had no deleterious effects on tissue viability (Fig. 4C). Analysis of the IL-1α content of the medium that contained the tissue revealed that treatment with 5% w/v SDS caused a 2000% increase in cytokine production relative to the negative control (Fig. 4D). The other treatments did not affect expression of the cytokine. All exposures were carried out for 60 min, followed by a 42 h recovery period, according to the manufacturers' recommendations. Tissues were then exposed to the higher concentration of the MN formulation, namely 5 mg ml−1 , for 60 min followed by a 42 h recovery period. This treatment of the tissues did not have any deleterious effects on their viability, while treatment with 5% w/v SDS caused a significant decrease in cell viability (p = 0.0153) (Fig. 4E). In the reciprocal IL-1α expression experiment, the IL-1α content of the medium was unaffected by treatment with 5 mg ml−1 of the MN formulation. In stark contrast, however, there was a marked increase in IL-1α expression (11,411 ± 316% relative to the negative control, p = 0.0004) by those cells treated with the positive control of 5% w/v SDS (Fig. 4F). The results of the work carried out using both 2D and 3D cultures outlined here was further underpinned by the results of the tolerance studies carried out in rats prior to the commencement of in vivo delivery of ibuprofen sodium, whereby the application of the dissolving MN arrays held in place using occlusive dressings for 24 h caused no irritation to the animals. The results of these two tolerance studies indicated that in vivo experiments could, therefore, commence. 3.10. In vivo drug delivery and quantification The most appropriate site for the application of the dissolving MN arrays was determined to be the back, adjacent to the spinal region, an area less likely to be easily scratched/groomed by the animal. In addition, this area was chosen so as to ensure that flexing of the abdominal cavity due to normal breathing and movement could not potentially cause MN arrays to detach from the skin during the course of experiments. The application and positioning of the MN arrays on the backs of the animals is exemplified in Fig. 5A. It was quickly deduced that MN arrays applied without the adhesive foam frame had a tendency to become expelled out of the skin upon release of the application pressure and loosening of the pinched skin. Therefore, in all in vivo experimentation, these adhesive frames were employed to secure the arrays in place over the course of the experiment. Following application of the dissolving MN arrays, a transdermal occlusive dressing was applied, covering and surrounding the arrays so as to prevent the animals from removing them during routine grooming. Four dissolving MN arrays were applied to the backs of each of four rats in any given experiment. The average ibuprofen sodium content in each dissolving MN array was approximately 76.4 mg. Therefore, as each rat had four dissolving MN arrays applied, each had an average total of 305.6 mg ibuprofen sodium applied in the experiment. As is clearly shown in Fig. 5B, the use of dissolving MN arrays to transdermally administer ibuprofen sodium resulted in a progressive increase in the plasma concentrations of the drug within the initial 4 h sampling period, with a maximal concentration of approximately 339 μg ml−1 achieved within that timeframe. Furthermore, the use of these dissolving MN arrays enabled sustained transdermal delivery of ibuprofen sodium over the 24 h investigation period, resulting in a final plasma concentration of approximately 263 μg ml−1 . 4. Discussion The data presented here represents the first time a high dose low molecular weight drug molecule has been delivered using dissolving microneedles to yield therapeutically-relevant plasma levels. The transdermal route has already been extensively investigated as a potential means of non-invasive administration of a range of non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), all of which have relatively high daily doses. The major challenge associated with transdermal NSAID delivery to date has been poor permeation across the stratum corneum. Dissolving MN arrays, capable of breaching the skin's outermost layer to enhance drug delivery, was the focus of the present study. A wide range of different polymeric formulations were cast into MN moulds and provisionally assessed for mechanical soundness and polymer/ drug homogeneity. The copolymer which showed the most potential was PMVE/MA. Blends of ibuprofen sodium/PMVE/MA were prepared and used to fabricate MN arrays. In contrast to all other formulations investigated here, the mechanical properties and homogeneity of the resultant arrays prepared from gels comprising 70% w/w of a 30% w/w PMVE/MA gel neutralised to pH 7.0 and 30% w/w ibuprofen-sodium were satisfactory. This formulation was, thus, chosen for subsequent study. These MN arrays successfully penetrated excised neonatal porcine skin and had a sufficiently high drug content to yield suitable in vitro and in vivo delivery. Increasing the drug content above 30% essing transdermal drug delivery. Delivery of ibuprofen sodium from dissolving MN arrays yielded extremely high and sustained blood plasma concentrations. The therapeutic blood levels of ibuprofen in humans range between 10 and 15 μg/ml [31]. Based on this knowledge and our in vivo results, we can cautiously approximate the patch size that might be necessary for use in human volunteers, appreciating the known differences in rat and human skin. An average human male weighs approximately 60 kg [32], which is 180 times greater than the weight of a 340 g rat (the average weight of rats used in these experiments). The blood plasma ibuprofen-sodium concentration achieved in the rats (263 μg ml−1 at the 24 h time point) were approximately 20 times greater than the human therapeutic plasma level and this was achieved with MN arrays of total approximate area of approximately 2 cm2 (4 × 0.49 cm2 ). By this rationale, a MN patch design of no greater than 10 cm2 could potentially deliver therapeutically relevant concentrations of ibuprofen sodium in humans. Typical commercialised transdermal patches can be as large as 30 or 40 cm2 (Novartis make Nicotinell® nicotine patches of 30 cm2 [33]; Janssen make Duragesic® CII (fentanyl) patches of 32 and 42 cm2 [34]). Accordingly, it is reasonable to suggest that, following further evaluation, first in pigs and then human volunteers, an optimised MN product could ultimately be developed based on the technology presented here. Indeed, Fig. 5(C–E) shows a 10 cm2 patch made from our ibuprofen sodium-loaded PMVE formulation. Although treatment of L-132 cell monolayers with 2.5 mg ml−1 ibuprofen-sodium led to a decrease in cell viability, it is extremely unlikely that the viable skin cells would be exposed to such high concentrations of ibuprofen sodium in vivo following MN application, as the fast dissolution kinetics of the MN arrays, coupled with the ability of the rich dermal microcirculation to rapidly absorb drug substances from the skin [14,22], would expedite the removal of the active from the local area. This observation is also of interpretational relevance in the case of L-132 cells treated with 0.232 mg ml−1 MN formulation, which resulted in increased release of the irritancy biomarker, while absolutely no skin irritation was observed in rats. Treatment of human keratinocytes in 3D culture (EpiSkin™) with the dissolving MN formulation (up to 5 mg ml−1 ) caused no significant reduction in the viability of these cells and no skin irritancy was caused by use of the MN system in the in vivo model, thus corroborating these points. It is notable that EpiSkin™ was endorsed by the European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM)'s Scientific Advisory Committee (ESAC) as ‘a reliable and relevant stand-alone test for predicting rabbit skin irritation’, and is seen as a valid replacement for animal studies of skin irritancy. EpiSkin™ was the only in vitro model so endorsed. The EpiSkin™ model is suggested as a suitable candidate for in vitro screening for skin irritation in ISO 10993-10 (Biological evaluation of medical devices — Part 10: Tests for irritation and skin sensitization). A loss of 50% viability following treatment and recovery is deemed to constitute irritancy according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Test Guideline 439 (In Vitro Skin Irritation: Reconstructed Human Epidermis Test Method). To this effect, 5% w/v SDS treatment of EpiSkin cultures resulted in a 62% drop in cell viability, identifying it as an irritant. The MN formulation reported here (5 mg ml−1 ), therefore, lies comfortably within the non-irritant range, with a loss of only 8.4% cell viability following treatment. In previous work carried out by our Group, the large-molecule payload of the dissolving MN arrays which was successfully delivered in vitro was confined to that amount of the active (insulin) contained within the individual needles of the arrays themselves [11]. In the current study however, this was not the case. The delivery of 1530 μg ibuprofen sodium, the theoretical mass of ibuprofen sodium contained within the dry MNs alone, was vastly exceeded over the course of the experimental period. In the in vitro studies, approximately 33 mg of the drug initially loaded into the arrays was delivered. This equates to approximately 90% of the total loaded drug being successfully delivered over the 24 h experimental period and demonstrates the significant potential of dissolving MN arrays in facilitated transdermal delivery of high dose low molecular weight drugs. 5. Conclusion The work presented here illustrates the potential of appropriatelyformulated dissolving microneedles to deliver a low molecular weight, high dose drug in therapeutically-relevant doses. This technology could potentially be harnessed to deliver large quantities of such nonpotent therapeutic agents across the skin's barrier layer without causing irritation. In this way, a common limitation of transdermal delivery, namely low delivery capacity for non-potent drugs, could possibly be overcome. This work, therefore, represents a significant progression in the utilisation of microneedle technologies for successful transdermal delivery of a much wider range of drugs. We are currently progressing towards clinical evaluations with a range of candidate molecules and are taking regulatory advice, given that at least 5 mg of polymer is deposited in each square centimetre of skin with this system. Investigation of accumulation/distribution and elimination of polymer from such a dissolving microneedle product designed for regular use is likely to be essential before regulatory approval.
