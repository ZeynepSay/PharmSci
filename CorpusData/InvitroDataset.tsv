1	1986	Cell Surface P-Glycoprotein Associated with Multidrug Resistance in Mammalian Cell Lines	Abstract. The plasma membranes of hamster, mouse, and human tumor cell lines that display multiple resistance to drugs were examined by gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. In every case, increased expression of a 170,000-dalton surface antigen was found to be correlated with multidrug resistance. This membrane component is of identical molecular size and shares some immunogenic homology with the previously characterized P-glycoprotein of colchicine-resistant Chinese hamster ovary cells. This finding may have application to cancer therapy. Selection of variants in mammalian cells that are resistant to specific drugs, such as Vinca alkaloids, maytansine, colchicine, anthracyclines, actinomycin D, or bleomycin, is often accompanied by expression of a complex phenotype of cross resistance to various unrelated drugs (1-14). This characteristic is referred to as the multidrug resistance phenotype. The generation of such variants in tumor cells may be an important mechanism by which neoplasms become resistant to treatment by combination chemotherapy. Studies in model systems indicate that multidrug resistance results from a reduced cellular accumulation of the drugs involved (5-19), and changes in the plasma membrane have been observed (17- 23). In the well-characterized colchicineresistant (CHR) Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) system, for example, genetic analyses involving cell-cell hybrids, drug-sensitive revertants, and DNA-mediated transformants of the CHR phenogenesis may also be explained as hypoxic regulation. The P02 of the corneal stroma has been measured at as low as 30 mmHg [M. Kwan, J. Niinikoski, T. K. Hunt, Invest. Opthalmol. 11, 108 (1972)]. When 107 metabolically active cells are implanted into the stroma, they may rapidly deplete the stroma of 02 and establish sufficient hypoxia to stimulate the expression of angiogenesis factor. 10.

Moreover, the expression of a 170,000-dalton plasma membrane glycoprotein (P-glycoprotein) is invariably associated with this pleiotropic phenotype (20-22, 24). The degree of drug resistance is correlated approximately with the amount of Pglycoprotein present (20, 22). The objective of the present study is to determine whether or not P-glycoprotein expression is also associated with the multidrug resistance phenotype observed in other cell systems. Each of the different mammalian cell lines examined in this study (Table 1) was originally selected for resistance to a specific drug, and in each case a multidrug resistance phenotype typified by cross resistance to unrelated compounds was observed. Such a phenotype appears to reflect a membrane-associated alteration (6, 24, 26). We therefore pre pared membranes from these cell lines component could not be detected by for analysis of their components by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (22). For CHR CHO cells (lanes b to d in Fig. IA), a protein having a molecular size of about 170,000 daltons appeared in the plasma membrane with a staining intensity proportional to the degree of resistance to the drug. As previously characterized, this band is referred to as the Pglycoprotein (20, 22). Similarly stained bands of approximately the same molecular size are seen in the other drugresistant cell lines that we examined (lanes e, h, j, and 1 in Fig. IA). Such a protein staining in the corresponding drug-sensitive parental cells (lanes a, g, i, and k) or drug-sensitive revertant (lane f). As a means of further characterizing the relatedness of the 170,000-dalton membrane components observed in these drug-resistant lines, an antiserum to plasma membrane vesicles of the highly colchicine-resistant CHO line CHRC5 was prepared. The specificity of this antiserum for the P-glycoprotein was improved by cross absorption with immobilized, detergent-solubilized plasma membrane proteins of the parental drug-sensitive line (21, 27). The absorbed antiserum was then used to examine the membrane components of the lines shown in Fig. lA. Each of the drugresistant lines expressed a 170,000-dalton component that was stained by this antiserum (Fig. 1B). It is clear from the size and cross-reactivity of this component that it is similar to the P-glycoprotein of the CHR CHO cells. Staining of other components of about 50,000 and 200,000 daltons is also observed with this antiserum. We believe that these components are not related to the P-glycoprotein or multidrug resistance because they Fig. 1.

(A) Gels were loaded with 10 p.g of membrane protein per lane. They were overstained by the silver staining method of Switzer et al. (34) and were then reduced to acceptable intensity by soaking in a solution of 0.03M ferric ammonium sulfate in 0. 18M sulfuric acid diluted 1:10, followed by a final rinse in 0.3M sodium carbonate and thorough washing in water. Molecular size standards (Bio-Rad) are shown in the first lane. These consist of 0.1 ,ug each of myosin, (200,000), P-galactosidase ( 116,250), phosphorylase b (92,500), bovine serum albumin (66,200), ovalbumin (45,500), carbonic anhydrase (31,000), soybean trypsin inhibitor (21,500), and lysozyme (14,400).

The P-glycoprotein region is indicat  branes. The relatively faint staining of the presumptive human P-glycoprotein by the antiserum is likely due to reduced cross-reactivity of this component with the antiserum against the CHO cell Pglycoprotein. To further corroborate the above conclusions, we stained the membrane components with an antiserum to plasma membrane of the vinblastine-resistant, human cell line, CEM/VLB1OO (Fig. IC). In this case, the serum was not previously absorbed with membrane proteins from drug-sensitive cells, and many antigens common to both drug-resistant and drug-sensitive human cells were strongly stained (lanes k and 1; note the exposure time). This crude antiserum stained only the drug resistance-associated P-glycoprotein in the rodent cell membranes (Fig. IC). Thus, of the dozen or so different cell surface antigens that can be detected with the two antiserums, only the P-glycoprotein is consistently stained in all drug-resistant mammalian cell lines tested. These observations, and the fact that a side-by-side comparison of the different P-glycoprotein bands reveals no significant difference in molecular size, as shown in Fig. 1, strongly indicate that the P-glycoprotein is conserved relative to other mammalian membrane antigens that are detectable by Western blotting. Our observations that P-glycoprotein is present in increased amounts in various drug-resistant lines, and that in the CHR CHO system the amount of Pglycoprotein expressed is correlated with the degree of resistance, are consistent with a mechanism of resistance involving gene amplification. The appearance of double minute chromosomes 23 SEPTEMBER 1983 has been correlated with unstable drug resistance in known gene-amplified systems (28, 29). Double minute chromosomes have also been observed in association with multidrug resistance in several mouse cell lines including colchicine-resistant lines for which the degree of resistance and P-glycoprotein expression correlate with the number of double minutes contained within the cells (14, 30). Double minutes have also been reported in multidrug-resistant hamster cells that were originally selected for colchicine resistance (30, 31). This speculation on the origin of the P-glycoprotein in drug-resistant cells suggests its preexistence, in much smaller amounts, in the drug-sensitive parent cell. In this context, we observed a barely detectable, antigenically cross-reactive band of the same molecular size as the P-glycoprotein in all the drug-sensitive cells examined in Fig. lB when the film was exposed for a much longer period (data not shown). What specific role the Pglycoprotein might play in the maintenance of the multidrug resistance phenotype, or in the drug-sensitive cells, is unknown. It is also not yet known whether the P-glycoprotein is expressed in normal tissues. Our findings could have important implications for cancer therapy. It is possible that clinical resistance to combination chemotherapy might result from an unchecked proliferation of tumor cell subpopulations with a multidrug resistance phenotype (33). The present data indicate that there is a strong correlation between the expression of multidrug resistance and surface P-glycoprotein in different species of drug-resistant cells established in vitro. It is reasonable to suppose that such a relationship might also exist in vivo. If P-glycoprotein is commonly present in tumor cells from patient biopsies, and if this antigen is expressed in increased amounts in tumors nonresponsive to treatment by combination chemotherapy, immunochemical screening for the antigen could provide a rapid diagnostic basis for planning treatment of cancer patients. Moreover, hitherto unresponsive tumors may become amenable to treatment with Pglycoprotein-targeted antibodies conjugated with toxins.	DAVID R. KNIGHTON THOMAS K.

2	1987	Expression of a multidrug-resistance gene in human tumors and tissues	ABSTRACT The identification and cloning of a segment of a human multidrug resistance gene (mdrl) was reported recently. To examine the molecular basis of one type of multidrug resistance, we have prepared RNA from human tumors and normal tissues and measured their content of mdrl RNA. We find that the mdrl gene is expressed at a very high level in the adrenal gland; at a high level in the kidney; at intermediate levels in the lung, liver, lower jejunum, colon, and rectum; and at low levels in many other tissues. The mdrl gene is also expressed in several human tumors, including many but not all tumors derived from the adrenal gland and the colon. In addition, increased expression was detected in a few tumors at the time of relapse following initial chemotherapy. Although controlled clinical studies will be required, our results suggest that measurement of mdrl RNA may prove to be a valuable tool in the design of chemotherapy protocols. Resistance to multiple chemotherapeutic agents is a common clinical problem in the treatment of cancer; such resistance may occur in primary therapy or be acquired during treatment. To study the problem of multidrug resistance, several laboratories have isolated cell lines resistant to the vinca alkaloids, doxorubicin (former generic name, adriamycin), actinomycin D. and related agents (1-7). Decreased drug accumulation as a result of increased drug efflux is found in such cell lines (3, 8). These multidrug-resistant cells contain an amplified gene, which we have termed mdrl, that is transcribed into a 4.5-kilobase (kb) mRNA (9-13). The protein product of this gene is the 170-kDa membrane glycoprotein which is expressed in multidrug-resistant cell lines (1, 3, 4, 7). This glycoprotein binds vinblastine, and this binding can be inhibited by vincristine and daunomycin as well as by agents, such as verapamil, that reverse multidrug resistance (14, 15). The sequence ofthe human mdrl gene has been determined and shows the presence of transmembrane regions and nucleotide binding sites, consistent with the function of the 170-kDa glycoprotein as an energy-dependent drug-efflux pump (16). We have described elsewhere the isolation and characterization of multidrug-resistant human KB carcinoma cell lines (6-8, 17). In collaboration with the laboratory of I. Roninson (Univ. of Illinois Medical School, Center for Genetics), we have isolated from one of these human cell lines a DNA probe for the mdrl gene (18). Using this mdrl probe, we have shown, in several multidrug-resistant cell lines and in genetransfer experiments, a correlation between the level of mdrl mRNA levels and the degree of multidrug resistance (9, 19). In addition, we have shown that increased mdrl gene expression can occur prior to gene amplification in the development of drug resistance in tissue culture. Since expression of the mdrl gene is responsible for multidrug resistance in tissue culture systems, we measured levels of mdrl mRNA in normal human tissues and in untreated and treated human cancers. Our results show that some normal tissues and tumors express the mdrl gene at elevated levels. We suggest that measurement of the levels of mdrl mRNA may prove to be useful in guiding chemotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS Materials. Deoxycytidine 5'-[a-32P]triphosphate (3000 Ci/ mmol; 1 Ci = 37 GBq) and uridine 5'-[a-32P]triphosphate (3000 Ci/mmol) were from New England Nuclear. Promega Biotec (Madison, WI) was the source of pGEM4 and the Riboprobe Gemini system II, and New England Nuclear manufactured the nick-translation system. All other reagents were of the highest purity available. Cell Lines. KB-3-1 is the drug-sensitive parental cell line. KB-8-5, which is 3 times as resistant to doxorubicin and 6 times as resistant to vinblastine, was derived in two steps from KB-3-1 (6). This cell line has increased levels of mdrl mRNA without gene amplification (9). Cell line KB-V1 (Vbl) was isolated in successive steps from KB-3-1; it is 420 times as resistant to doxorubicin and 210 times as resistant to vinblastine (7). It has amplified the mdrl gene and expresses mdrl mRNA at a very high level. Three neuroblastoma cell lines (HTB 10, HTB 11, and CCL 127) and a colon carcinoma cell line (HTB 38) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Colon carcinoma cell lines (WIDR and LS-174) were gifts from J. Schlom (National Cancer Institute). The rat pheochromocytoma line PC12 was obtained from M. Nirenberg (National Institutes of Health). mdrl Hybridization Probes. cDNA was prepared from KB-C2.5 cells, which contain large amounts of mdrl mRNA, and inserted into the EcoRI site of bacteriophage Xgtll. A simplified cDNA restriction map is shown in Fig. 1. Details of the isolation and characterization of this cDNA will be published elsewhere (23). The mdrl probes utilized were obtained from contiguous areas starting at the 5' end of the mdrl cDNA and cover more than half of the total cDNA. Probe 10 was labeled by nick-translation before use in the slot blot analysis. Probe 5A was cloned into the EcoRI site of pGEM4 and used to make an RNA probe with SP6 RNA polymerase (20). This RNA probe was used in all blothybridization analyses of electrophoretically fractionated RNA. A p-actin cDNA was kindly provided by B. Paterson (National Cancer Institute). RNA Extraction, Electrophoresis, and Blot Analysis. All samples were kept frozen at -70°C. Solid tumors were pulverized on a metal surface placed on a bed of dry ice, prior to RNA extraction. Frozen buffy coats from leukemia samples were thawed rapidly at 37°C and centrifuged. Total cellular RNA was extracted by homogenization in guanidinium isothiocyanate followed by centrifugation over a cesium  3arose/6% formaldehyde gels as described (9). Six or eight iicrograms of total RNA was loaded per lane. With one (ception, only samples in which the ribosomal RNA apeared undegraded were analyzed. Hybridization was in the reviously described (9) buffers for 16 hr at 55°C with 2 x 106 ?m of synthetic RNA per ml. The blots were washed by idition of lx SSC/0.1% NaDodSO4 warmed to 68°C at )om temperature every 20 min for 1 hr, followed by two )-min washes with O.1x SSC/0.1% NaDodSO4 in a 700C ater bath. (1 x SSC = 0.15 M NaCl/15 mM sodium citrate, H 7.) Autoradiographic exposures were for 2-4 days. Slot Blot Analysis. The filters were presoaked in lOx SSC, nd then 10 ,ug of total RNA in 100 ,ul of lOx SSC was oplied. After baking, prehybridization and hybridization ere performed at 42°C using the same buffers as for the NA-electrophoretogram blot experiments, with 106 cpm of ick-translated cDNA per ml. After hybridization, the filter as washed twice for a total of 1 hr at room temperature in x SSC/0.1% NaDodSO4. Then lx SSC/0.1% NaDodSO4 kat had been warmed to 680C was added at room temperaire twice over 1 hr. Autoradiograms were exposed for 1-3 ays. Hybridization with a P-actin RNA probe was per- )rmed to compare RNA loading. The levels of mdrl expreson were determined by densitometry of the autoradigrams.  e levels of mdrl mRNA were measured in samples of Drmal tissues and various tumors as described in Materials id Methods. A typical analysis of some normal tissues is iown in Fig. 2, and the results from a variety of experiments ^e summarized in Table 1. In each experiment, RNA from .B lines with increased drug resistance and increased levels f mdrl mRNA were included so that the unknown samples )uld be directly compared with samples of known mdrl NA content and known multidrug resistance. Relative to rug-sensitive KB-3-1, the multidrug-resistant subline KB- .5 has a 40-fold increase in mdrl mRNA and KB-V1 (Vbl) is a greater than 500-fold increase.

(Lower) Six micrograms of total RNA was electrophoresed in each lane before blot analysis, except for the Vbl and Pheo 6 lanes, which were loaded with 1 ,ug and 0.5 ,g of total RNA, respectively. The three neuroblastoma (Neurob) samples were from patients who had failed treatment with combination chemotherapy that included vincristine and doxorubicin. Only the relevant portion of the autoradiogram is shown; position of 28S rRNA, which served as an internal marker, is indicated at left.

(Lower) Total RNA (8 ,ug per lane) was electrophoresed before blot-hybridization analysis. The figure is a composite of several gels and different autoradiographic exposures.

On long exposures the 4.5-kb mdrl message could be visualized along with degraded products. rectum had intermediate levels. The majority of organs and tissues had low levels, in the range of mdrl mRNA levels found in our most drug-sensitive (parental) cell line, KB-3-1. The levels of mdrl mRNA were elevated in many tumors derived from the adrenal gland (Figs. 3 and 4 and Table 2). These included many pheochromocytomas, one adrenocortical carcinoma, and a few neuroblastomas. In all cases, a 4.5-kb mRNA species was detected, indicating that a similar mRNA was present in all the tumors. Both malignant and benign pheochromocytomas had increased mdrl mRNA levels. Of particular interest was pheochromocytoma 1, because samples of this malignant tumor were available before and after treatment with a regimen containing vincristine. The tumor initially responded but then became unresponsive. Levels of mdrl mRNA were increased 6-fold in the sample obtained at autopsy. Also shown in Fig. 3 are samples of three neuroblastomas from children who relapsed following combination chemotherapy that included vincristine and doxorubicin. These levels are higher than those measured in one untreated patient (data not shown) and in 12 neuroblastoma cell lines, three of which (HTB 10, HTB 11, and CCL 127) are shown in Fig. 4. Since most neuroblastoma cell lines have been established from untreated patients, it seems likely that low levels ofmdrl mRNA are present in primary tumors. PC12, a rat pheochromocytoma line, had low levels of mdrl mRNA, as did normal rat adrenals (data not shown). Childhood cancers Neuroepithelioma Ewing sarcoma Rhabdomyosarcoma Acute lymphoblastic leukemia Fig. 5 presents the results obtained in eight patients with primary colon carcinomas; mdrl mRNA levels in the tumors (T) or in nearby normal colon (N) are shown for each patient. Generally, normal colon and the tumors had mdrl mRNA levels in the intermediate range, although one set was in the high range and one was in the low range. No correlation could be established with the histology or degree of anaplasia. Two human colon carcinoma lines (WIDR and HTB 38) had low levels, and line LS-174 had intermediate levels (data not shown). Figs. 6 and 7 present the results with samples obtained from patients at the time of relapse following initial chemotherapy. All patients had received at least one of the drugs included in the multidrug-resistance phenotype. The slot blot shown in Fig. 6 consists of six samples obtained from children at the time of relapse. The level of mdrl RNA in one of the patients with a rhabdomyosarcoma is 10-fold higher than that of the other rhabdomyosarcoma. The level in skeletal muscle and in two other rhabdomyosarcomas was also low (data not shown). Although more extensive studies will be needed, this may be another example of an acquired increase in the level of mdrl message. Fig. 7 shows blot-hybridization analysis of total RNA extracted from the leukemic cells of 10 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, all of whom had >90% circulating lymphoblasts. The four lanes labeled I represent samples from patients at initial presentation. The lanes labeled R represent samples from patients that relapsed following combination chemotherapy that included vincristine and daunomycin. All four samples from the untreated patients and five of the six from the relapsed patients had low levels of mdrl RNA. However, one of the samples obtained from a patient at the time of a second relapse had levels that were 10-fold higher, raising the possibility that this increase had been acquired during drug therapy. DISCUSSION In the present study we have measured expression of a gene associated with multidrug resistance (mdrl) in many normal human tissues and human cancers. Our results show that the mdrl gene is expressed at a very high level in the adrenal gland; at high levels in kidney; at intermediate levels in lung, liver, jejunum, colon, and rectum; and at low levels in many other organs. We also found elevated mdrl expression in several human tumors. Many, but not all, tumors derived from the adrenal gland and the colon, organs with elevated mdrl mRNA levels, had high levels of mdrl expression. Increased levels were also observed in some tumors at the time of relapse following initial chemotherapy. mdrl Expression in Normal Tissues. The survey of normal tissues showed that mdrl is expressed at low levels in most 8-5 R R R R R R 28Si FIG. 7. mdrl expression in 10 samples of peripheral blood lymphocytes from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Total RNA (8 ,ug per lane) was electrophoresed before blot-hybridization analysis.

Lane at left contained RNA from the multidrug-resistant line KB-8-5. organs and at higher levels in a few. The increased levels of expression in some organs implies that the mdrl gene product may have a normal function in these tissues. In kidney, liver, colon, or adrenal, mdrl could have a role in the excretion of organic molecules, and the same system could also be employed to transport drugs out of cancer cells. In normal tissues, mdrl expression was often found to vary from sample to sample. For example, of nine lung tissues examined, two had somewhat higher amounts. The basis of the variation is unknown, but a number of possibilities exist. One is that tissues contain many different types of cells and the proportion of each cell type may vary. A second is that individuals may vary, depending on genetic or environmental factors. To understand the basis of this variation, the technique of in situ hybridization, which allows measurements of RNA levels in individual cells, should be helpful. This technique might also allow one to determine whether drugresistant cells preexist in a tumor or emerge following treatment. Expression of mdrl in Tumors from Untreated Patients. Elevated mdrl mRNA levels were detected in tumors arising from the adrenal medulla (pheochromocytoma) and adrenal cortex (adrenocortical carcinoma), as well as in colon carcinomas. This finding indicates that the mdrl gene can continue to be expressed when a normal cell is converted into a malignant cell. The results in pheochromocytomas indicate that high levels can be expected in a majority of these tumors. Our findings with colon carcinomas suggest that, in some cases of colon cancer, increased expression of the mdrl gene might be involved in the intrinsic resistance of these tumors to chemotherapeutic agents. Expression of mdrl in Tumors from Treated Patients. Increased levels of mdrl message were seen in some of our samples obtained from patients who relapsed after initial chemotherapy. Tissue from one pheochromocytoma was available before treatment and after therapy with a regimen including vincristine. After an initial response, the patient had progressive disease and died. The level of mdrl expression was increased at least 6-fold in the autopsy sample and may be an example of acquired multidrug resistance due to increased expression of the mdrl gene. This increased mdrl expression may represent reactivation of a previously active gene or selection of clones, initially present in the tumor, that contain higher levels of the mdrl message. High expression was also detected in neuroblastomas from patients who failed treatment with a regimen containing vincristine and actinomycin D. A sample from one untreated patient and many neuroblastoma cell lines from untreated patients show low mdrl expression (unpublished data). We also studied 10 patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia. One for whom treatment failed had distinctly elevated levels of mdrl mRNA. It is also of interest that one rhabdomyosarcoma from a patient treated with vincristine and actinomycin D had high mdrl mRNA levels, whereas three other rhabdomyosarcomas and normal skeletal muscle did not. Control of mdrl Expression and Correlation of Levels of Expression with Drug Resistance. In cell lines selected for high levels of multidrug resistance, amplification of the mdrl gene is commonly observed (9). However, in mutants with lower levels of resistance, such as KB-8-5, we have detected increased mdrl expression without gene amplification. The levels of mdrl RNA detected in many tumors are comparable to KB-8-5 or lower and probably represent only increased mdrl transcription, suggesting that, in a clinical setting, gene activation might be a more common means of developing resistance than gene amplification. The levels of mdrl RNA expression have been shown (9, 19) to correlate with the degree of drug resistance in human KB carcinoma cells with increased drug resistance. The parental cell line KB-3-1 is very drug-sensitive and expresses a very low level of mdrl mRNA (which is arbitrarily set at 1). KB-8-5, which is 3 times as resistant to doxorubicin and 6 times as resistant to vinblastine, has an mdrl mRNA level around 40, and KB-V-1, which is 420 times as resistant to vinblastine and 210 times as resistant to doxorubicin, has an mdrl mRNA level >500. From the results presented here, we cannot identify a level of mdrl mRNA that confers drug resistance. However, the mdrl mRNA levels in the acute lymphoblastic leukemia samples were <10 in all but two cases. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia is a drug-sensitive malignancy, and our findings are in agreement with this observation. Clinical Implications. It seems likely that more than one mechanism contributes to the process of multidrug resistance. The ability to identify a group of tumors that display multidrug resistance by measuring the levels of mdrl mRNA could have many important consequences. First, determination of the level of mdrl mRNA could allow the identification of tumors likely to fail to respond to a given drug. Clinical studies invariably include a fraction of patients with unresponsive tumors, with no clear explanation for why some patients fail while others respond. Identification of patients likely to fail could lead to the use of alternative treatment programs. Second, the level of mdrl mRNA could be used as a guide for the selection of drugs. For example, our data suggest that a vinca alkaloid, doxorubicin, or actinomycin D might not be effective in the therapy of pheochromocytoma. In a combination regimen, the lack of efficacy of these drugs would be obscured. Studies comparing regimens with and without these drugs would probably require a large number of patients in order to demonstrate statistical significance, and in a disease like pheochromocytoma, such a study might not be possible. A third and related use would be to assess recurrent tumors to determine whether resistance to a given agent has developed during initial therapy. This information could be used to identify those patients who might benefit from continued therapy with the same or similar drugs, as well as to select a group of patients who have developed resistance and for whom specific therapy might be considered. Drugs such as verapamil, diltiazem, and quinidine have been found to overcome multidrug resistance in cell culture and in some animal experiments (8, 21, 22). It would be of interest to use verapamil or a drug with similar action but fewer side effects in tumors that have high levels of mdrl expression. Possible candidates identified in this report include certain pheochromocytomas, adrenal carcinomas, and carcinomas of the colon. In addition, since the product of the mdrl gene appears to be a glycoprotein that is found in the plasma membrane, antibodies to this protein, either by themselves or in combination with toxins or radioisotopes, may be useful in selectively killing cancers containing high levels of this protein. In conclusion, we have measured levels of mdrl mRNA in human tissues and human tumors because multidrug resistance in tissue culture systems is associated with elevated mdrl mRNA levels. We have found thit mdrl mRNA is present at high levels in many untreated cancers of the adrenal and colon and in a few treated and unresponsive tumors of other organs. Although controlled clinical studies will be required, our results suggest that measurement of the level of mdrl mRNA may prove to be a valuable tool for guiding chemotherapy. We thank I.

3	1990	Expression of the Multidrug Resistance Gene Product (P-.Glycoprotein) in Human Normal and Tumor Tissues’	We have characterized the normal human tissue distribunon and tumor expression of the human multidrug resistance gene (MDRJ) product P-glycoprotein (Pgp) by immunohistochemical staining of frozen tissue sections of human normal and tumor tissues, using three mouse monoclonal antibodies (MAb) which recognize at least two different epitopes of Pgp. Pgp expression on normal human tissues was detected in specialized epithelial cells with secretory/excretory functions, trophoblasts in the placenta, and on endothelial cells ofcapillary blood vessels at blood-tissue barncr sites. There were significant differences in the staining patterns of these MAb. Mouse MAb HYB-241 and HYB- 612 each recognize an extracellular epitope of Pgp, whereas mouse MAb C219 detects a carboxy terminal intracellular epitope and has recently been reported to crossreact with the MDR3 gene product. HYB-241 and HYB-612 strongly stain endothelial cells and trophoblasts, whereas C219 is weakly positive or unreactive on these cells. Likewise, C219 strongly stains the biliary pole of hepatocytes, skeletal and heart muscle fibers, whereas HYB-241 and HYB-612 are unreactive on these cells. Immunopathological studies were performed on a wide variety of human tumors. Pgp expression on human tumors was most commonly detected in colon, renal, and adrenal carcinomas; rarely in lung and gastric carcinomas and certain germ cell tumors; and was undetectable in breast and endometrial carcinomas tested. Few sarcomas and none of the melanomas, neuroblastomas, gliomas, and pheochromocytomas had detectable Pgp expression. Intensity and pattern ofstaining varied among different cases ofa given tumor type; although homogeneous immunoreactivity was observed, heterogeneity of expression in a single histological section was more common. The finding of Pgp expression in a variety ofnormal tissues with diverse physiological functions suggests that the role of Pgp may not be limited to excretion ofxenobiotics. Pgp expression in capillanes ofthe brain and testis may explain the failure of drugs such as vincristine and actinomycin-D to penetrate into these tissues, allowing them to remain as pharmacological sanetuanes for malignant cells. Although Pgp expression can now be detected in a variety of human tumors, further studies are needed to establish the possible significance of this finding. ( Introduction The term “multidrug resistance” (MDR) describes the phenomenon whereby tumor cells in culture, when selected for resistance to a single cytotoxic agent, simultaneously develop broad crossresistance to a variety ofstructurally and functionally unrelated cornpounds (1). The importance ofthis laboratory model is that it may advance our understanding of the complex clinical problem of resistance to multiple drugs which is characteristic of many human tumors. Multidrug-resistant cells consistently overexpress an Mr 170,000-180,000 membrane glycoprotein known as P-glycoprotein (Pgp) (2-5). Amplified DNA sequences from experimentally derived multidrug-resistant cell lines have been shown to encode Pgp (6-10). The amino acid sequence of Pgp has been deduced from full-length or partial eDNA sequences of human, mouse, or Chinese hamster Pgp genes. The human MDRI gene encodes a protein of 1280 amino acids which consists oftwo highly homologous halves. This molecule contains 12 transmembrane domains and two putative AlP binding sites. Sequence analysis has revealed structural homology between the MDRI gene and bacterial genes encoding periplasmic active transport and export systems (11-13). Pgp is believed to be responsible for MDR by functioning as an energydependent drug efflux pump of broad specificity (14,15). In an effort to better understand the normal function of this protein and its potential role in mediating one form of drug resistance in hu man tumors, we have examined its normal tissue distribution and expression in tumors, using immunohistochemical techniques. Materials and Methods Cell Lines. The human melanoma cell line BRO and a variant transfected with a human MDRI cDNA under control of a CMV promotor and HBV polyadenylation signals (BRO/T cell line) were supplied by Dr. Piet Borst (Netherlands Cancer Institute). Parental neuroepithelioma MC-IXC and the drug-resistant variant MC-IXC/VCR. were provided by Dr. June L. Biedler (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center). Tissues. Histologically normal adult human tissues and tumors were obtained from surgical pathology specimens within 1-2 hr ofresection and autopsy specimens within 10 hr of death. Several normal specimens from each organ site of different individuals, ranging from two to 12 samples, were used for the present study. A wide variety of human tumors, including 85 carcinomas, 25 germ cell tumors, 20 melanomas, 14 sarcomas, five pheochromocytomas. seven neuroblastomas, and five astrocytomas also were examined. Tissues were histologically well preserved. Fresh tissues were immersed in isopentane pre-cooled in liquid nitrogen, embedded in OCT compound in cryomolds (Miles Laboratories; Naperville, IL). and stored at - 70’C until needed. Alternatively, tissues were fixed in buffered 10% formaldehyde, dehydrated in graded alcohols and xylol. and embedded in paraffin. Reagents. Mouse monodonal antibodies (MAb) HYB-24l and HYB- 612 were supplied by Hybritech (San Diego, CA). These antibodies are mouse immunoglobulins of the IgGi subclass. They were utilized as purified Ig preparations at approximately 20 ıig/ml in PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin (PBS/BSA). Mouse MAb C2l9 was used for the present study as a purified Ig preparation at 20 jig/mI (Centocor; Malvern, PA). As a negative control, purified mouse MAb directed against the cell surface antigen anthranylate synthase of E. colt was used at the same working dilutions (bcr-25; Oncogene Science. New York, NY) (20 ıag/ml). As a positive control, purified MAb against cytokeratins and other intermediate filaments (e.g.. neurofilaments) were also used at the same concentrations (20 ıag/ml; Cambridge Research Laboratories, Cambridge. MA). Secondary antibodies used were: (a) goat anti-mouse IgG (gamma + light chain specific) affinity-purified antibodies, peroxidase conjugated ( I :50 dilution in PBS) (Tago; Burlingame. CA); and (b) biotinylated horse anti-mouse lgG (heavy + light chain specific) affinity-purified antibodies (1:100 dilution in PBS), followed by avidin-biotin-peroxidase complexes (l100 dilution in PBS) (Vector Laboratories; Burlingame, CA). Immunocytocbemical Technique. Immunocytochemistry was performed using fresh cells grown on microslides and fixed with cold acetone for 10 mm. Both indirect immunoperoxidase and avidin-biotin complex methods were used, according to methods previously described (16,17). The secondary antibodies were used as indicated above. Diaminobenzidine (DAB) was used as chromogen (5 mg ofDAB tetrahydrochloride in 100 ml ofPBS with 100 pI ofO.3% hydrogen peroxide). The DAB solution was filtered and incubated with the cells for 6-12 mm. After treatment, cells were washed with distilled H20, counterstained with hematoxylin, and mounted with permount. lmmunohistochemical Technique. To ensure that tissue sections would adhere, slides were cleaned in 95% alcohol and subbed in 0.3% gelatin solution containing 0.05% chromium potassium sulfate in distilled water. Frozen and deparaffinized tissue sections were used in this study. Cryostat-cut tissue sections (4-8 ı.tm thick) were used, unfixed or fixed for 10 mm with either 1% formalin in PBS (pH 7.4), cold acetone, or 95% ethanol. Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched by incubation with 0.1% hydrogen peroxide in distilled H2O for 10 mm. Tissue sections were washed three times in PBS for 5 mm each and then incubated with blocking serum (10% normal horse serum in 2% PBS-BSA) for 20 mm. All incubations were performed at room temperature in wet chambers. Blocking serum was drained offand the primary antibody incubated for 1 hr. appropriate dilution having been previously established. Sections were washed with PBS and incubated for 45 mm with secondary horse anti-mouse biotinylated antibodies, also previously titrated for optimal dilution (llOO in PBS), followed by avidin-biotin-peroxidase complexes (1100 in PBS) (see above). DAB was used as chromogen (5 mg ofDAB tetrahydrochloride in 100 ml of PBS with 100 sI ofO.3% hydrogen peroxide). The DAB solution was filtered and incubated with the tissue sections for 6-12 mm. After treatment, the sections were washed with distilled H20, counterstained with hematoxylin, and mounted with permount. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections were deparaffinized, then quenched for 15 mm in 1% hydrogen peroxide in distilled H2O. Deparaffinized sections were treated with several enzymes or detergents (see below), washed several times in PBS, and incubated with 10% normal horse serum (blocking serum) for 20 mm. The blocking serum was removed and the sections incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4’C. The secondary antibodies and avidin-biotin complexes were used as indicated above. Sections were extensively washed and the immunoreactions developed by using DAB (see above). Finally. the sections were washed with dH2O. counterstained with hematoxylin. and mounted with permount (16,17). Enzymatic Digestion and Detergent Treatment of Deparaffinized Tissue Sections. To assess the possibility of masking owing to fixation of the antigens under study, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues were pretreated with the following protocols: 1. Pronase: sections were treated with 0.0025% pronase (Calbiochem; LaJolla, CA) in Tris buffer, pH 7.6, for 4-6 mm. The reaction was terminated by washing in PBS containing 0.2% glycine (Sigma; St Louis, MO). 2. Pepsin: sections were treated with 0.1% pepsin (Sigma) in 0.01 N HCI buffer, pH 2.25. for 30 mm. The reaction was stopped by repeated washing in distilled H20. 3. Trypsin: sections were treated with 0.1% trypsin (Gibco; Grand Island, NY) in Tris buffer, pH 7.6, for 5-20 mm. The reaction was stopped by incubation with soybean trypsin inhibitor(Sigma) diluted in PBS. 4. Saponin: deparaffinized sections that were not pre-digested with proteolytic enzymes were treated with 0.05% saponin (Sigma) in distilled H20 for 30 mm. They were then washed several times in PBS. Controls. Frozen and paraffin-embedded cell lines and/or normal tissues expressing the appropriate antigen(s) were used for titration of the reagents. as well as positive controls. Negative controls included substitution of the primary antibody by a similar antibody of the same species and subtype (bcr-25; see above), or substitution ofthe primary antibody by PBS alone. Results Specificity Analysis of Monoclonal Antibodies Detecting P Glycoproteins Mouse MAb HYB-241 and HYB-612 each recognize an extracellular epitope of Pgp (18-21). Mouse MAb C219 binds to a carboxy terminal intracellular epitope containing an amino acid sequence shared by the MDR3 gene product (22,23). The specificity of these antibodies for Pgp is demonstrated by their binding to the BRO/T cell line, transfected with and expressing the MDR1 gene, whereas there is no detectable binding to the non-transfected parental BRO Expression of Pgp on Human Normal Tissues We utilized MAb HYB-241, HYB-612, and C219 to localize Pgp expression in histological sections from normal adult human tissues. lmmunostaining on frozen tissue sections was intense, reproducible, and reliable. Immunoreactivity was lost after tissue fixation and paraffin embedding, and enzymatic digestion of deparaffinized tissue sections did not improve Pgp detection. Significant levels of Pgp are found on a wide variety of epithehal cells, including but not limited to those with secretory/excretory functions. In addition, prominent expression is found on placental trophoblasts and on a subset ofcapillary endothelial cells. Detailed observations on specific tissues and cell types within these tissues are presented in Table 1 and discussed below. Skin. Immunohistochemical staining with MAb HYB-241, HYB-612, and C219 showed no reactivity with human epidermal keratinocytes. Sweat glands and ducts were immunoreactive; the pattern of staining was luminal. Sebaceous glands and connective tissue fibroblasts were unreactive. No staining was observed on melanocytes or dendritic cells within the epidermis. Endothelial cells of medium size and larger blood vessels were non-reactive; however, capillary endothelial cells in the papillary dermis showed patchy immunoreactivity, which was more prominent with MAb HYB- 241 and HYB-612 than with C219 Nervous System. Areas studied include brain parenchyma (i.e., frontal cortex), brainstem (i.e. , thalamus), cerebellum, and spinal cord. No Pgp expression was detected on neurons or glial cells. Endothelial cells ofsmall blood vessels and capillaries showed strong homogeneous immunoreactivity for HYB-241 and HYB-612, whereas staining with C219 was consistently less intense (see below). No staining was observed in meningeal and submeningeal cells. Peripheral nerves, including endoneurial and perineurial cells, were unreactive for the three antibodies. Hematopoietic Tissues. Lymphocytes in thymus and lymph nodes were non-reactive for Pgp. White and red pulp cells of spleen, circulating blood cells, and tissue macrophages all failed to stain. Bone marrow was not examined. Respiratory Tract. Epithelial cells lining the trachea and major bronchi stained strongly, revealing an apical pattern of reactivity (Figure 1E). Cartilage and mesenchymal cells were unreactive. Staining of minor bronchi was patchy or absent. Pneumocytes in alveoli were not stained. The specificity of the staining of bronchial epithelial cells was confirmed using irrelevant mouse MAb (IgGi subclass) as negative control. Gastrointestinal Tract. Epithelial cells of the esophageal mucosa were negative. In the stomach, surface epithelial cells of the pits stained diffusely with a secretory pattern. Cells located in the crypts of the small intestine and colon were unreactive; however, intense staining was observed in the apical brush border ofcells lining the lumen of the small and large bowel (Figure lC). The intensity of staining was again stronger for HYB-241 and HYB-612 than that of C2l9. Hepatocytes in the liver showed intense immunoreactivity at their biliary canalicular pole for C219 but not for HYB-24l and HYB-612 (Figures 1G and 1H). However, epithelial cells lining the biliary ducts stained strongly with a luminal pattern of immunoreactivity for all three antibodies. Mesenchymal cells and Kuppfer cells were unreactive. Acinar cells ofthe exocrine pancreas showed a weak and heterogeneous pattern of reactivity. Immunostaining was stronger and diffuse in epithelial cells lining major pancreatic ducts. Urinary Tract. Intense immunoreactivity was present in proximal convoluted tubules of the kidney, with no differences seen between pars convoluta and pars recta (Figure 1A). Epithelial cells of Henle’s loops showed minimal immunoreactivity, whereas none was found in distal tubules and collecting ducts. Glomeruli were unreactive, and transitional epithelial cells of the ureter and unnary bladder had no detectable Pgp. Endocrine System. Homogeneous and intense immunoreactivity was present in the adrenal cortex, whereas chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla were unreactive (Figure 1B). Focal staining was observed at the luminal edge ofcells ofthe thyroid. Pancreatic islets ofLangerhans and C-cells ofthe thyroid were unneactive. Neuroendocnine cells of the gastrointestinal tract had no detectable Pgp. The pituitary gland was not examined. Reproductive System. Focal immunostaining for Pgp was detected in epithelial cells of adult mammary gland and prostate. Immature germ cells and more mature spermatocytes and oocytes in testes and ovaries were unreactive. No Pgp was detectable in cithen Leydig or Sertoli cells. However, capillary endothelial cells surrounding the seminiferous tubules of the testes were immunoreactive. Endothelial cells of the ovaries had no detectable Pgp (see below). All other cell types in testis and ovary were unreactive. Epithelial cells of the uterine cervix were unreactive. However, glandular epithelial cells of the endometnium showed a heterogeneous luminal pattern of immunoreactivity. Placental trophoblasts demonstrated strong homogeneous staining for HYB-241 and HYB-6l2 (Figure lF), whereas weak immunoreactivity was observed for C219. A subgroup ofskeletal muscle and all myocardial fibers stained intensely with MAb C219, but not with MAb HYB-241 or HYB- 612 (Figures II and 1J). Expression ofPgp on Endothelial Cells Strong expression of Pgp was found on endothelial cells of capillary blood vessels in the brain and several other organs (Table 2) (24,25). In addition to capillaries of the central nervous system, including different sites of the cerebral cortex (Figure 1E), brainstem, cerebellum, and spinal cord, we now extend this observation to include other vascular beds. Endothelial cells localized in the endoneurium ofperipheral nerves were patchily stained with these antibodies. Capillaries ofthe testes, mainly those surrounding the seminiferous tubules, were also immunoreactive. Finally, endothelial cells ofcapillanies in the papillary dermis, as well as scattered endothelial cells of capillaries in the cervix, endometnium, esopha-ı gus, and bronchi, also stained with HYB-24l and HYB-6l2 (see Table 2). Expression ofPgp on Human Tumors Immunopathological studies were performed on a wide variety of tumors, including carcinomas, sarcomas, pheochromocytomas, neuroblastomas, and melanomas. Pgp was frequently identified in carcinomas, as previously reported (26-28). However, it should be emphasized that although homogeneous patterns of immunoreactivity were seen heterogeneity of expression was more common. Table antibodies. Two other tumors, one ofthem superficial, showed oc- 0 casional cell staining. The rest of the cases were unreactive. 0 Nine out of 11 colon carcinomas stained variably for Pgp, five ofthem with a strong homogeneous staining. The pattern of stain- 0 ing was enhanced at the luminal site (Figure 2D). One out of three 0 cases ofgastric adenocarcinoma was heterogeneously reactive, with 0 approximately 30% of tumor cells being positive. Six ofeight hepatocarcinomas were heterogeneously immunoı reactive for MAb C219, while none ofthese tumors stained for HYB- 0 241 and HYB-612 (Figures 2F and 2G). 0 All adrenocortical carcinomas studied showed strong homogeneous immunoreactivity for all three antibodies used in this study (five of five cases) (Figure 2B). None of the five pheochromocytomas analyzed showed detectable levels of Pgp (Figure 2C). Twenty-two non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLC) were studied (19 epidermoid cell carcinomas and three adenocarcinomas) (Figure 2E). Only two of the 22 NSCLC showed reactivity, which was patchy with approximately 20% of the tumor cells staining. Both cases were adenocarcinoma. No Pgp expression was detected on two primary pulmonary carcinoids. None of eight cases of breast cancer studied reacted with the MAb. However, apparently normal parenchymal glands in some of the tissue sections studied showed staining in occasional cells. Similarly, none of the three endometnial carcinomas analyzed showed detectable levels of Pgp.  Neuroectodermal Tumors and Sarcomas. None of the 20 melanomas examined showed detectable levels of Pgp. Similarly, none ofseven cases ofneuroblastoma (which included three adrenal neuroblastomas) or five cases of brain astrocytoma had detectable 1evels ofPgp. However, two of 14 soft tissue sarcomas were heterogeneously stained for the three antibodies. Discussion This study reports the detailed microanatomic localization of Pgp in normal human tissues, and a survey of its expression in human tumors using immunohistochemistry. Three MAb recognizing at least two different epitopes ofPgp were used in this study to minimize false-positive results due to antibody binding ofsimilar epitopes shared by other proteins, and to minimize false-negative results from failure ofantibody binding due to tissue-specific processing of Pgp. Monoclonal antibodies directed against different regions of Pgp have been developed (15,19,22), and have been used to identify and localize this molecule immunohistochemically in some human normal and tumor tissues (24-31). A detailed biochemical charactenization of the specificity of HYB-241 and HYB-612, and comparison with C219, has recently been reported, and has demonstrated that although all three antibodies recognize products of the MDRJ gene, different electrophoretically distinct forms ofthis protein can be identified. Whereas MAb HYB-241 and HYB-612 will immunoprecipitate a narrow well-defined band of M1 180,000, C219 recognizes both a broad Mr 170,000180,000 species and the narrow M1 180,000 band (19). The availability of MAb capable of distinguishing specific forms of Pgp supports the hypothesis that heterogeneity exists at the protein level for the MDRJ gene product. The existence ofa discrete Mr 180,000 Pgp is not a new observation, for it has been reported by Beck and colleagues (32). Although the Mr 170,000 and Mr 180,000 Pgp species can be distinguished electrophoretically, it is not presently known what structural features distinguish these proteins and whether any functional differences exist between these molecules. The data reported in this study allow us to suggest that the antigenically distinct form of Pgp identified by HYB-241 and HYB- 612 is a physiologically important form, on the basis of its expression in the tissues described above. Whether or not the different forms of Pgp have qualitative or quantitative differences in function cannot be addressed by the present data. Expression ofPıglycoprotein in Epithelial Cells with Excretory/Secretory Functions embedded tissue sections when compared with frozen tissue sections from the same cell lines and organs. Satisfactory and reliable immunoreactivity was not obtained with either untreated or enzyme-digested deparaffinized tissue sections using any ofthe three antibodies. It is likely that the determinants recognized by HYB- 241, HYB-612, and C219 are irreversibly masked or denatured through formalin fixation and processing. Therefore, we recommend frozen tissue sections for analysis of Pgp when using these antibodies. The data reported and discussed in the present study pertain to fresh cell lines and frozen sections of human tissues. As shown in Table 1, all three antibodies detect Pgp expression in a wide variety ofsimple glandular epithelial cells. Luminal but not crypt cells ofthe large and small intestine strongly express Pgp. In the kidney, expression is restricted to epithelial cells of both pars convoluta and pars recta of the proximal tubule. In the adrenal gland, intense homogeneous expression is identified in the cortical cells but not in the chromaffin cells ofthe medulla. These results are in general agreement with previous reports (23,31), with the exception of the adrenal medulla, in which studies employing Northern dot-blot analysis of isolated RNA reported the presence ofPgp expression (29). Such an analysis is susceptible to false-positive results, because the Pgp-rich adrenal cortex cannot be reliably dissected free of the adrenal medulla, owing to the absence of tissue planes separating these structures and the presence of projections ofcortical tissue into the medulla as a standard anatomic feature of this organ (33). Previously unreported sites of Pgp expression include sweat glands ofthe skin, bronchial epithelial cells, and foci ofglandular epithelial cells ofthe prostate, breast, endometnium, thyroid, and a particular subset ofendothelial cells to be discussed in greater detail below. A distinctive pattern of immunoreactivity is seen when these three antibodies are used to examine the liver. As demonstrated in Figure 1, MAb C219 stains the biliary canalicular pole of hepatocytes, as well as the secretory pole ofbiliary ductal epithelial cells. In contrast, only biliary ductal cell staining and no hepatocyte staining is seen with HYB-241 and HYB-612. Epitope mapping studies for C219 demonstrate that this antibody recognizes an amino acid sequence shared by the MDR3 gene product (23). Although the specific amino acid sequence comprising the epitope recognized by HYB-241 or HYB-612 is not known, the possibilities are limited by the amount of Pgp that is extracellular. Comparison of the proposed extracellular sequences for MDRJ and MDR3 gene products identifies no sequence ofabsolute identity (34,35), reducing the likelihood that HYB-241 and HYB-612 are capable of recognizing the MDR3 gene product. One possible interpretation ofthe staining pattern observed in the liver, therefore, is that MDR3 expression is being detected in hepatocytes by C219, whereas MDRI cxpression is being detected by all three antibodies in the bile duct cells. Such a possibility is further supported by the known expression ofMDR3 in hepatocytes (34). Alternatively, the antigenically distinct forms of the MDRJ gene product described above may be differentially expressed in hepatocytes vs biliary ductal cells. Examination ofskeletal muscle reveals no reactivity with HYB- 241 and HYB-612; however, intense immunoreactivity is seen with MAb C219 in a subset ofmuscle fibers, as previously reported (25). Similarly, intense staining is seen in all cardiac muscle fibers with C219, but not in smooth muscle or any other myogenic cells with either of the antibodies. Expression ofPglycoprotein at Blood-Tissue Barrier Sites We have previously reported the expression of Pgp on capillary endothelial cells ofbrain, testis, and papillary dermis ofthe skin (24). We also identified the association ofsuch expression with the continuous non-fenestrated arrangement ofthese capillary blood yessels, as well as the recognition ofthese anatomic locations as pharmacological sanctuaries (24,36,37). In the present study, we extend this observation with the detection of Pgp expression in endoneunial capillaries, as well as in scattered capillary endothelial cells in the cervix, endometnium, esophagus and bronchi. Table 2 lists the pattern of immunoreactivity observed in capillary endothelial cells ofvanious tissues examined with the three antibodies. Less intense immunostaining is consistently seen with C219 as compared with HYB-241 and HYB-612. In those cases where staining with HYB- 241 and HYB-612 is weak, no staining is seen with C219, most likely representing a difference in binding affinity between these antibodies. Differential Expression of Pglycoprotein in Human Tumors Previous studies using clinical material have shown high levels of expression of MDR mRNA in tumors derived from cells normally possessing Pgp, such as renal and colon carcinomas (26-28). Dctectable levels of Pgp have also been reported in a variety of human tumors (38-42). The data reported here confirm some of the observations made in previous studies and contain several new and important findings. Pgp expression in the 182 human tumors analyzed is summanized in Table 3. Expression is found most frequently in tumors derived from tissues normally expressing this protein, such as renal, colon, and adrenocortical carcinomas. Conversely, we have found no Pgp expression in normal or tumor cells with squamous epithehal differentiation, as exemplified by the 18 epidermoid carcinomas of the lung lacking detectable Pgp expression. Similarly, tumor cells of neuroectodermal origin, such as melanomas, neuroblastomas, and adrenal pheochromocytomas, had no detectable Pgp. The lack ofsuch expression in the tumors ofadrenal medullary origin is consistent with the observed lack of Pgp in normal adrenal chromaffin cells. Interestingly, despite the consistently intense expression of Pgp in placental trophoblasts, the three gestational trophoblastic tumors examined had no detectable Pgp. The intensity of Pgp expression can vary from one sample to another for a given tumor type, and considerable heterogeneity of expression is commonly seen within a given tumor. Such a pattern of Pgp expression in tumor cells is consistent with the phenotypic variability commonly observed in human neoplasms. The failure to detect Pgp expression in a variety of clinically unresponsive tumors, such as melanomas and epidermoid carcinomas, suggests that resistance mechanisms other than those involving Pgp are likely to be operative. Finally, it is also clear that Pgp can be expressed in tumors derived from cell types that do not normally express this protein. Examples in this category are some urinary bladder and germ cell tumors, as well as certain sarcomas. Several differences in immunostaining are observed between C219 and HYB-241 in certain normal tissues and in tumors denived from them. Six of the eight hepatocellular carcinomas studied stained with C219 but not with HYB-241. Similar to the pattern of reactivity in normal liver seen with these antibodies, this observation raises the possibility that, in hepatocellular carcinomas, C219 is recognizing the MDR3 and not the MDRI gene product. Previous reports describing MDR expression in hepatocellular carcinomas have measured extracted RNA using a probe capable of hybridizing to the MDR3 gene and thus not specific for MDRI. Clarification of this question will await the examination of hepatocellular carcinomas with MDRJ-specific probes, or the defininyc demonstration that HYB-241 does not recognize the MDR3 gene product. These findings emphasize the need for caution in selecting antibodies to perform clinicopathological correlations of MDR in human tumors. Implications for the Pathophysiological Function of Pglycoprotein On the basis of the observations reported here, several points can be made. Pgp expression has been identified in certain normal tissues with diverse physiological functions, including excretory/scenetory cells such as proximal tubules of kidney and biliary ducts of liver, as well as in endothelial cells at blood-tissue barrier sites and in trophoblasts in the placenta. Pgp was also detected in epithelial cells lining the bronchial lumens, sweat glands of the skin, and pancreas. The identification of Pgp expression in these organs is ofparticular interest in light ofthe recent demonstration of structural homology between this protein and the cystic fibrosis gene product (43-45). Cystic fibrosis is a disease characterized by abnormal membrane chloride transport, with manifestations primarily affecting lung, sweat glands, and pancreas, among other tissues. The structural similarities of these proteins, their chromosomal proximity, and their co-expression on a subset of tissues suggest that Pgp expression may be regulated as a component ofa gene family of membrane transport proteins. The ease of detection of Pgp using monoclonal antibodies and immunohistochemistry encourages evaluation ofthis technique as a potential clinical tool. Although Pgp expression can now be detected in a variety ofhuman tumors, furtherstudies are still needed to establish the possible clinical significance of this finding and to understand Pgp expression in the context ofother biological featunes of the tumors.

4	1997	Analysis of Expression of cMOAT (MRP2), MRP3, MRP4, and MRP5, Homologues of the Multidrug Resistance-associated Protein Gene (MRP1), in Human Cancer Cell Lines	ABSTRACT By screening databases of human expressed sequence tags, we have identified three new homologues of MRP1, the gene encoding the multi drug resistance-associated protein, and cMOAT (or MRP2), the canabicu lax multispeclfic organic anion transporter gene. We call these new genes MRP3, MRP4, and MRPS. MRP3, like cMOAT, is mainly expressed in the liver. MRP4 Is expressed only at very low levels in a few tissues, and MRPS, like MRPJ, is expressed In almost every tissue tested. To assess a possible role of these new MM' homobogues in multidrug or cisplatin resistance, a large set of resistant cell lines was examined for the (over)expression of MRPJ, cMOAT, MRP3, MRP4, and MRPS. We find that even in cells selected for a low level of resistance, several MRP-related genes can be up-regulated simultaneously. However, MRP4 is not overex pressed in any of the cell lines we analyzed; MRP3 and MRPS are only overexpressed in a few cell lines, and the RNA levels do not seem to correlatewith resistanceto either doxorubicinor cisplatin.cMOATis substantially overexpressed in several cell lines, and cMOAT RNA levels correlate with clsplatin but not doxorubicin resistance in a subset of resistant cell lines. Our results emphasize the need for gene-specific blocks in gene expression to define which transporter contributes to resistance in each resistantcell line. INTRODUCTION After selection for resistance to a single cytotoxic drug, cells may become cross-resistant to a whole range of drugs with different structures and cellular targets, a phenomenon called MDR.3 In human cancer cells, MDR can be caused by enhanced drug efflux mediated by transporter proteins such as the MDR1 P-glycoprotein (reviewed in Refs. 1 and 2) and MRP1 (reviewed in Refs. 3 and 4). Both are members of the ABC family of transporter proteins (5). In contrast to P-glycoprotein, MRP1 can act as a GS-X pump, i.e., it can transport drugs conjugated with GSH, because: (a) the rates of AlP-dependent transport of several GSH-conjugated compounds have been shown to correlate with the level of expression of MRPJ in several cell prepa rations (6, 7); (b) overexpression of MRPI in human cancer cells resulted in an increased AlP-dependent transport of GSH S-conju gates into isolated plasma membrane vesicles and from intact cells (7â€”9); (c) depletion of GSH in cells overexpressing MRPJ reversed resistance (10, 11); and (d) MRP1 complemented yeast cells with a disrupted cadmium resistance factor (YCFJ) gene (12), a known organic anion transporter (13, 14). GS-X pumps have also been reported to be involved in the detox ification of heavy metals (15â€”20).The cell lines described in these papers were all selected for resistance against CDDP (cisplatin), and all showed an increased AlP-dependent transport of GS-platinum complexes across the plasma membrane. Cisplatin is known to inter act with cellular GSH, and a complex with a 2: 1 molar ratio of GSH:cisplatin has been detected in Lb2bO murine leukemia cells (15). Transport of the GSH/cisplatin complex across the cell membrane was found to be AlP dependent,inhibitedby vanadate,DNP-SG, LTC4, and oxidized glutathione (GSSG). Only in the human leukemia CDDP-resistant HL6O/R-CP cell line was an increased GS-X activity correlated with an increased expression of MRPI ( 16, 17). It is, therefore, likely that other GS-X pumps exist, besides MRPI. More over, several MDR cell lines selected with natural product drugs display a MDR phenotype that cannot easily be explained by the overexpression of MDRJ or MRPJ, also suggesting that other drug transporters might exist (20â€”28). A GS-X pump that might contribute to drug resistance is cMOAT. The cDNAs encoding cMOAT have recently been identified in rats and humans (29â€”33).This homologue of MRPJ (49.0% identity with human MRP1 at the protein level), also known as MRP2, is mainly expressed in the canalicular membrane of hepatocytes. The identifi cation of transport-deficient mutant rat strains, the TR or GYITR rats (34) and the Eisai hyperbilirubinemic rats (35), has contributed to the functional characterization of cmoat (36). These rats have an autosomal recessive defect in the hepatobibiary excretion of bibirubin glucuronides and other multivalent organic anions, including GSH S-conjugates (for example LTC4) and 3-OH-glucuronidated and -sub fated bile salts. Paulusma et a!. (29) showed that a b-bp deletion in the cmoat gene is responsible for the absence of cmoat in the TR rats. TR rats have a similar phenotype as patients with the Dubin-Johnson syndrome, characterized by mild chronic conjugated hyperbiliru binemia (37). Recently, we and others have shown that the cMOAT protein is also absent in canalicular membranes of hepatocytes of patients with the Dubin-Johnson syndrome (30, 38). In the one patient analyzed thus far, the absence of cMOAT was caused by a mutation in the cMOAT gene (30). In addition to MRPJ and cMOAT (MRP2), other MRP homologues encoding GS-X pumps might be present in the human genome, considering that there are at least four MRP homologues expressed in Caenorhabditis elegans (39). We, therefore, searched the EST library (40) for putative human MRP homobogues and found three more MRP homobogues expressed in humans. We call these new MRP homo bogues MRP3, MRP4. and MRP5. To investigate a possible robe of MRP homologues in drug resist ance, we examined a large set of (mubti)drug-resistant cell lines for the (over)expression of cMOAT, MRP3, MRP4, and MRP5. We find that especially cMOAT expression is elevated in several cell lines, selected for cisplatin resistance, and also in some sublines of the human  non-small lung cancer cell line SW1573/Sl, selected for doxorubicin resistance. The expression level of cMOAT correlates with the cispla tin but not the doxorubicin resistance of these cell lines. Although MRP3 and MRP5 were overexpressed in some resistant cell lines, no clear correlation between drug resistance and the expression levels of MRP3, MRP4, and MRP5 has emerged from these initial studies. MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell Lines. All cell lines used in this study have been described in the literature before: the drug-sensitive and doxorubicin-selected MDR sublines of the non-small cell lung cancer cell lines SW1573/Sl and COR-L23 (41â€”44); the small cell lung cancer cell line GLC4 (45); the lung adenocarcinoma cell line MOR/P (44); the leukemia cancer cell line HL6O (46); the 124 bladder carcinoma cell line and three CDDP-resistant sublines (26); the 2008 ovarian carcinoma cell line, two CDDP-resistant sublines, and a Cd2-resistant subline (21, 22); the A2780 ovarian carcinoma and the HCT8 colon carcinoma cell lines and CDDP-resistant sublines of both (20, 28); the PXN94 ovarian carcinoma and the tetraplatin-resistant subline PXN94tetR (23); the GCT27 testicular carcinoma cell line and the CDDP-resistant subline GCT27cisR (25); and the KB-3â€”l epidermoid carcinoma cell line and a CDDP-resistant subline KCP-4 (18, 19). All cells were grown in DMEM or RPMi 1640 (Life Tech nologies, Inc.), supplemented with 10% FCS, 2 mM glutamine, penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 @g/ml).All cells were free of Mycoplasma as tested by the use of the Gene-Probe rapid Mvcoplasma detection system (Gen-Probe, San Diego, CA). Clonogenic Survival Assays. The drug sensitivity of cells was determined in clonogenic survival assays in the continuous presence of drugs. Five hundred cells/well were seeded in 24-well plates and incubated for 24 h at 37Â°CD. rugs, of which concentrations were varied in 2-fold steps, were added, and cells were incubated for 5â€”d6ays at 37Â°CA. fter this, the cells were stained with 0.2% crystal violet in 3.7% glutaraldehyde, and colonies containing more then 50 cells were counted. The relative resistance was calculated as the ratio of IC@ (inhibitory concentration where 50% of the cells survive) of the resistant cell line to the ICS() of the parental cell line. Cloning and Sequencing of MRP3, MRP4, and MRP5 cDNA. For the isolation of MRP3, MRP4, and MRP5 eDNA, human eDNA clones were obtained from the IMAGE. consortium (47). Additional MRP3 eDNA clones were isolated by screening a human liver 5' stretch plus eDNA library, oligo(dT) and random primed (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), using a 1-kbEcoRI Sad fragment of a human eDNA clone (no. 84966, Stratagene liver eDNA library 937224) as probe. Several overlapping cDNAs were isolated and sequenced. For MRP4, the insert of a human eDNA clone (no. 38089, Soares infant brain INIB eDNA library) was sequenced, containing the 3'-terminal end of the gene. MRP5 eDNA clones were isolated by screening a fetal brain eDNA library (Clontech), using the insert of human eDNA clone (no. 50857, Soares infant brain INIB eDNA library) as probe.4 Several overlapping cDNAs were isolated and sequenced. For sequencing, the ABI 377 automatic sequencer was used. Sequence analysis was done using the GCG package of Wisconsin University, version 9.0 (48). All of the sequences have been deposited with GenBank (MRP3 accession number U83659; MRP4 accession number U83660; and MRP5 accession number U8366l). RNA. Cytoplasmic RNA from cell lines was isolated by a NP4O lysis procedure (49). Total cellular RNA from tissue samples obtained during surgery or at autopsy was isolated by acid guanidinium isothiocyanate-phenol chloroform extraction (50). RNase Protection Assays. By PCR amplification of human cMOAT eDNA, a 24l-bp fragment corresponding to nucleotides 4136â€”4376(Ref. 30; GenBank accession number U49248) was generated. The primers used for amplification were 5'-CTGCCTCTFCAGAATCTFAG-3' (forward primer) and 5'-CCCAAGTrGCAGGCTGGCC-3' (reverse primer). For MRP3, MRP4, and MRPS RNA detection, the following fragments were generated by PCR amplification: (a) for MRP3, a 262-bp fragment was generated using the primers 5'-GATACGCTCGCCACAGTCC-3' (forward primer) and 5'- CAGTTGGCCGTGATGTGGCTG-3' (reverse primer); (b) for MRP4, a 239-bp fragment was generated using the primers 5'-CCA'VTGAAGATCT 4 J. Wijnholds, C. Mol, and P. Borst. unpublished results. TCCTGG-3' (forward primer) and 5'-GGTG1TCAATCTGTGTGC-3' (re verse primer); (c) for MRP5. a 38l-bp fragment was generated using the primers 5'-GGATAACUCTCAGTGGG-3' (forward primer) and 5'- GGAATGGCAATGCTCTAAAG-3' (reverse primer). All of the fragments were cloned into pGEM-T (Promega Corp., Madison, WI), resulting in the plasmids hcMOAT-241, MRP3-262, MRP4-239, and MRP5-38 I , and the sequences were confirmed. For RNase protection assays, a-32P-labeled RNA transcripts were transcribed from NotI-linearized DNA of hcMOAT-24l and MRP3â€”262u,sing 17 RNA polymerase, or from NcoI-linearized DNA from MRP4-239 and MRP5-381, using Sp6 RNA polymerase. For MDRJ RNA detection, a 301-bp MDRI eDNA fragment was used [nucleotide positions 3500â€”3801(51)], and for MRPJ RNA detection, a 244-bp MRPJ eDNA fragment was used [nucleotide positions 239â€”483 (52)]. RNase protection assays were carried out according to Zinn et a!. (53), modified by Baas et a!. (41). Protected probes were visualized by electrophoresis through a denaturing 6% acrylamide gel, followed by autoradiography. In all experiments, a probe for y-actin (54) was included as control for RNA input. The amount of MDRJ, MRPJ, cMOAT, MRP3, MRP4, or MRP5 RNA relative to the amount of â€˜y-actinwas calculated using a phosphorimager (Fuji BAS 2000, TINA 2.08b). Protein Analysis. Totalcell lysatesweremadeby lysing harvestedcells in 10 msi KCI, 1.5 mistMgCl2, 10mMTns-HCI (pH 7.4), and 0.5% (w/v) SDS supplemented with 1mMphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin (2 @g/ml), pepstatin (I @g/mla),nd aprotinin (2 @xg/mlD).NA was sheared by sonication, and samples containing 40 @gof protein were fractionated by SDS/7.5% PAGE and then transferred onto a nitrocellulose filter by electroblotting. After blotting, the filters were blocked for at least 2 h in Blotto (PBS containing 1% BSA, 1%milk powder, and 0.05% Tween 20), followed by incubation for 2 h with the primary antibody in Blotto. cMOAT protein was detected with mouse monoclonal antibodies M,III-5 or M,III-6, generated against a bacterial fusion protein containing the 202-amino acid COOH-terminus of rat cmoat (29). Immunoreactivity was visualized with peroxidase-conjugated rabbit antimouse immunoglobulins (Dako, Copenhagen, Denmark) followed by enhanced chemiluminescence detection (Amersham, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). Fusion Proteins of cMOAT, MRP3, and MRP5. To test the cross reactivity of the cmoat monoclonal antibodies with human cMOAT and other MRPhomologues,fusion proteinsweremadeof the Escherichiacoli maltose binding protein with COOH-terminal ends of human cMOAT, MRP3, and MRP5, respectively, using the plasmid vector pMal-c (55). The expression plasmids encoded, respectively, for cMOAT the 202-amino acid COOH terminal end, for MRP3 the 190-amino acid COOH-terminal end, and for MRP5 the 169-amino acid COOH-terminal end. The fusion proteins were produced in E. co!i DH5a and purified by amylose resin affinity chromatog raphy (55). Glutathione Assay. Cells (1â€”2X 106per well) were plated in triplicate in six-well plates in medium with or without drugs. Forty-eight h after plating, the cells were washed with PBS and scraped in 10% perchloric acid. Precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was neutralized by adding 0.5 M4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid, 5 MKOH. The concentration of total glutathione (GSH and GSSG) was determined according to the recy cling method of Tietze (56). ChromosomeLocalizations.Forthechromosomelocalizationof MRP3, MRP4, and MRPS, radiation hybrid mapping was performed with MRP3-, MRP4-, and MRP5-specific primers and two different cell panels, Stanford 03 (StG3; Ref. 57) and Genebridge 4RH (Gb4RH; Ref. 58). The primers used for amplification were: (a) for MRP3 5'-CTCAATGTGGCAGACATCGG-3' and 5'-GGGAGCTCACAAACGTGTGC-3'; (b) for MRP4 5'-CCATfGAA GATCTFCCTGG-3' and 5'-GGTGTFCAATCTGTGTGC-3'; and (c) for MRPS 5'-CCTG1TFGGGAAGGAATATGA-3' and 5'-GGGTCGTCCAG GATGTAGAT-3'. For the PCR reactions, 25 ng DNA, 2 ng/pi ofeach specific primer, 0.8 unit Goldstar polymerase (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium; MRP3 and MRP4) or 1.5 units Amplitaq Gold polymerase (MRP5) were used in a total volume of 25 @.d with 1.5mMMgCl2and 100MMofeach deoxynucleotide triphosphate at final concentrations. The PCR conditions were: initial dena turation for 5 mm at 94Â°C(MRP3 and MRP4) or 12 mm at 95Â°C(MRP5), followed by 42 cycles of 15 s at 94Â°C, 30 s at 58Â°C, and 45 s at 72Â°C. Final extension was for 10 mm at 72Â°C.PCR products were resolved by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis, and the cell line scored positive, negative, or ambiguous for presence of the gene. Data files were submitted to the Stanford Human Genome Center or Whitehead Institute radiation hybrid mapping databases for placing of the MRP genes in context of the respective radiation hybrid map framework markers. Microsatellite Repeat Analysis. To confirm identity of cell lines and subelones, nine highly polymorphic microsatellite markers were used (D1S1649, D2S434, D2S1384, D3S2427, D9S301, D9S934, D12S2070, D14S611, and D17S969). PCR conditions were as described in the Genome Database. One primer of each set was labeled with a fluorescent dye, and PCR products were visualized by electrophoresis on an ABI 377 automatic Se quencer. Data were analyzed with Genetyper software version 1. 1. 1 (Perkin Elmer, Norwalk, CT). Allele sizes were within expected range. RESULTS Database Search for MRP Homologues. We searched human EST databases (dbEST and TIGR) for MRP homologues other than MRPJ and cMOAT. Alignment and comparison of EST sequences with homology specific to the 3'-terminal ends ofMRPJ and cMOAT, including the coding sequence for the second ATP-binding domain, revealed that there are at beast four more MRP homobogues expressed in humans. One of these homobogues is the human SUR gene (59). The other three MRP homobogues had not been identified before and were designated MRP3, MRP4, and MRP5. Cloning and Sequencing of MRP3, MRP4, and MRPS cDNA. Additional cDNA clones for MRP3 and MRP5 were isolated from a human liver and a fetal brain eDNA library, respectively. MRP3 and MRP5 eDNA clones were sequenced as well as the MRP4 eDNA clone obtained from the I.M.A.G.E. consortium. Both MRP3 and MRP5 encode four domain proteins, i.e., proteins with two AlP binding domains and two domains with transmembrane regions.5 More sequence data are required to determine whether this is also the case for MRP4. Fig. 1 shows the protein alignment for the COOH terminal ends of the various members of the human MRP family, including the recently identified sixth MRP gene, called MRP6 (see â€oeDiscussionâ€a•n),d human SUR. The alignment includes the Walker A and B motifs and the signature sequence (C) of the second ATP binding domain. The percentages of homology for the COOH-termi nab 124 amino acids are shown in Table 1. The highest homology is found between MRP1 and MRP3 (83% similarity) and the lowest between SUR and any of the MRPs (59% similarity). Chromosome Localization of MRP3, MRP4, and MRPS. The MRPJ gene has been mapped to chromosome 16 at band p13.13â€” 13.12 (60), and recently the cMOATgene was mapped to chromosome 10, band q24 (33, 61). We mapped the other MRP homobogues on the Gb4RH and StG3 radiation hybrid mapping panels, using MRP3-, MRP4-, or MRP5-specific primers. MRP3, MRP4, and MRP5 are located on chromosomes 17, 13, and 3, respectively. The most closely linked markers were D17S797 (Gb4RH) and D1751989 (StG3) for MRP3, WJ-9265 (Gb4RH) and D135281 (StG3) for MRP4, and WI 6365 (Gb4RH) and D354205 (StG3) for MRP5. These results are consistent between the radiation hybrid mapping panels and demon strate that the new MRP homobogues are indeed new genes and not splice variants of MRPJ or cMOAT. Human Tissue Distribution of cMOAT, MRP3, MRP4, and MRP5 RNA. RNase protection assays were performed to determine the tissues that express cMOAT and MRP3, MRP4, and MRP5. The results are summarized in Table 2. Both cMOATand MRP3 are highly expressed in liver and to a lower extent also in duodenum. Low expression of cMOAT was found in kidney and peripheral nerve. For MRP3, substantial expression, similar to expression in duodenum, was also detected in colon and adrenal gland. MRP4 is expressed at a bow bevel in only a few tissues tested. MRPS RNA was detected in substantial amounts in every tissue tested, with relatively high expres sion in skeletal muscle and brain. Expression of MRP Homologues in Resistant Cell Lines. In view of their homology with MRPJ, cMOAT and the three new MRP homobogues might encode transporter proteins involved in drug re sistance. We, therefore, screened a large set of human cell lines derived from various tissues and their resistant sublines selected with either doxorubicin, cisplatin, tetraplatin, or CdCl,. Only resistant lines showing decreased cellular accumulation of drugs were analyzed. All cell lines were analyzed by RNase protection assays for levels of MDRJ, MRPJ, cMOAT, MRP3, MRP4, MRP5, and y-actin RNA. The results are summarized in Tables 3 and 4, and an example of each probe is shown in Fig. 2. High MDRI overexpression was detected only in two sublines of the human non-small cell lung cancer cell line SW1573/Sl, both selected for high level doxorubicin resistance (2R160 and lR500). The low level of MDRI RNA in the other cell lines is not remarkable, because most of the cell lines selected for our panel were known to have a non-Pgp MDR phenotype. Low MDRJ overexpression was found in the 2R120, a subline of the SW1573/Sl, and in three cisplatin-selected sublines of the bladder carcinoma cell line T24. Interestingly, a decrease rather than an increase in MDRJ RNA was seen in two cisplatin-selected sublines of the ovarian carcinoma cell line 2008 (Table 4). This phenomenon has been reported earlier in the SW1 573/S 1 subbines lR5Ob, 2R50, and 3R80, selected for low level doxorubicinresistance (Refs. 41 and 42: Table 3). MRPJ RNA is only highly overexpressed in the four non-Pgp MDR cell lines GLC4/ADR, MORIR, COR-L231R, and HL6O/ADR, all selected for high level doxorubicin resistance (52, 62, 63). The doxo rubicin selected cell lines, derived from the SWI 573/S 1 cell line, showed no or only a minor increase in MRPI RNA, as reported before (52, 64). In the cell lines, selected for cisplatin resistance, we detected no major changes in MRPJ RNA. Only in two sublines of the T24 cell line, T24/DDP7 andT24/DDP1O,and in HCT8IDDP,a subline of the colon carcinoma HCT8 cell line, a slight (less than 2-fold) increase in MRPJ RNA was found. Expression of cMOAT varied greatly between the cell lines. Most parental cell lines did not express cMOAT or only at very low bevels. Only the MOR/P and the KB-3â€”bparental cell lines showed substan tial cMOAT RNA levels. Overexpression of cMOAT was found in several doxorubicin-resistant sublines of SW 1573/S 1 (30.3M, 1R50b, 2Rl20, 2Rl60, and 1R500) and some cisplatin-selected cell lines (2008/Cl3*5.25, 2008/A, A2780/DDP, and HCT8/DDP). Similar to cMOAT, most parental cell lines either did not express MRP3 or only at very low levels. The only two parental cell lines, which show high expression of MRP3, the MOR/P and the KB-3â€”b, also show high expression of cMOAT. Overexpression of MRP3 in resistant lines was only found in several doxorubicin-resistant sub lines of the SW I573/S I cell line and the cisplatin-resistant HCT8/ DDP cell line. MRP4 is expressed only at low or very low levels in the cell lines we analyzed, and no overexpression of MRP4 was detected in resist ant sublines. MRPS is expressed in every cell line we analyzed, with the highest bevels in MOR/P and 2008, but in none of the resistant sublines is MRP5 highly overexpressed. Only in three cisplatin-resistant cell lines, T24/DDP1O, HCT8IDDP, and KCP-4(--), was a minor increase in MRP5 RNA detected. cMOAT Protein in Resistant Cell Lines. To investigate whether the increased cMOAT RNA levels in the resistant cell lines were accompanied by increased cMOAT protein bevels, total cell bysates cmoat protein (29). To test the specificity for human proteins of the Similar results were obtained with M2IH-5 and with M2III-6 (data not Mabs generated against rat cmoat, fusion proteins containing COOH- shown), indicating that the protein detected is cMOAT. The level of terminal ends of human cMOAT, MRP3, and MRP5 were made. Both cMOAT protein in each cell line correlated very well with the level of cMOAT Mabs, M2111-5 and M2III-6, recognize human cMOAT. cMOAT RNA, even for the cell lines with only a marginal increase in M2III-5 also reacts with the MRP5 fusion protein, and M2ffl-6 also cMOAT RNA, such as 2008/C13*5.25 and 2008/A. The only excep reacts with the MRP3 fusion protein on Western blot. No cross- tion was the cisplatin-resistant subbine of KB-3-l, KCP-4(â€”). The reaction was detected for both Mabs with MRP1 (data not shown). Western blot shows that the cMOAT protein bevel was about 2â€”3-fold Protein analysis of the cell lines with the cMOAT Mabs showed the higher in the KCP-4(â€”) cell line than in the KB-3-I, whereas the presence of a Mr l90,000200,000 protein in several lines (Fig. 3). RNA levels were the same in parental and resistant cells. Mab M2III-5 also reacts with MRP5, and MRP5 RNA is raised in the KCP-4( â€”) cells, but a similar result was obtained with Mab M,III-6, which does not cross-react with MRPS. All cell lines with no or only very low levels of cMOAT RNA also contained no detectable cMOAT protein (Fig. 3). The small amount of cMOAT detected in the parental A2780 cell line migrated faster in the gel than the cMOAT protein present in the cispbatin-resistant A2780/ DDP cell line or the protein detected in the HCT8, HCT8/DDP, KB-3--l , and KCP-4(â€”)cells. The varying mobility of cMOAT in the gel could be caused by different degrees of posttranslational modifi cation of cMOAT protein in each cell line, as we have observed for MRP1 (M)6 but this remains to be verified. GSH Assays. In view of the proposed role of cMOAT as a GS-X pump, intracellular GSH levels were measured for the cell lines in Table 4. OSH levels were elevated in all resistant cell lines (Table 4) and were not detectably different in cells cultured with or without drugs (data not shown). Drug Resistance of the Cell Lines Analyzed. To determine whether there is a correlation between the elevation of expression of putative transporters and resistance pattern, we have extended the existing information on these cell lines with a more complete survey of resistance against either cisplatin or doxorubicin (Table 5). Inter estingly, all of the doxorubicin-selected SW 1573 cell lines with over expression of cMOAT are also cross-resistant against cisplatin, and the level of cMOAT expression correlates quite well with the level of cisplatin resistance (Tables 3 and 5). Cytotoxicity analysis of the KCP-4(â€”)cell line showed that the IC50 for cisplatin for this cell line was much lower than reported [700 nM, RF 1.8 (Table 5) instead of 25.000 nM, RF 62.5; Ref. 18], suggesting that this cell line was a revertant or contaminated with another low level cisplatin-resistant cell line. When these KCP-4(â€”) cells were cultured in the presence of 6.7 @LMcisplatin, more than 99% of the cells died. The surviving population, KCP-4(+), was highly cisplatin resistant again (IC50 22.400, RF 59; Table 5), but surprisingly, did not express cMOAT anymore(Fig 3)@Mit.@rosaterlelipteatanalysisshowedthatbothcell bine@,KCP-4(â€”) and KCP-4(+), were derived from the parental KB-3- I, indicating that the KCP-4( â€”)is most likely a revertant. 6 M. Kool, unpubhhhed results. All cell lines selected for resistance against cisplatin, tetraplatin, or CdCl, are not cross-resistant against doxorubicin (Table 5), with two exceptions: the KCP-4( â€”) cell line and the PXN94/tetR cell line. Cross-resistance did not correlate with cMOAT expression. DISCUSSION The MRP Gene Family. Our database search of ESTs has revealed that at least five homologues of MRPI are expressed in humans. Two of these were already known. cMOAT or MRP2 encodes the major organic anion transporter in the canalicular membrane of hepatocytes (29â€”33,38). The product of another homologue, SUR. plays a role in the regulation of insulin secretion (59). The other three homologues, MRP3â€”5.are novel and are all more related to MRP1 than SUR (Table 1). Identity is highest between MRP1 and MRP3 (75%). Because the region taken for comparison is small and one of the most conserved parts of the protein, the overall identity between the MRP homologues will probably be lower than the percentages in Table I. Very recently, the complete sequence of another MRP homologue appeared in the database (GenBank accession no. U9l3l8).7 This new MRP-like gene, located on chromosome 16, band l6pl3.l 1 and next to MRPJ, is different from the five MRP genes we have described in this report; hence, we have called it MRP6. MRP6 is predicted to encode a protein of 1401 amino acids with 45% identity to human MRPI. In comparing the sequence of MRP6 with other sequences in the database, we found that the 3' end of MRP6 is almost 100% identical with the recently identified MRP-like half transporter called ARA, described by Longhurst et a!. (65). ARA is, therefore, possibly a splice variant of MRP6. Whether the complete MRP6 gene is also transcribed in tissues and cell lines is not known yet and we will investigate this. The newly identified MRP homobogues MRP3â€”5are all located on other chromosomes than MRPJ and cMOAT. This confirms that MRP3, MRP4, and MRP5 are indeed new genes and not alternative splice products of MRPI or cMOAT, Klugbauer and Hofmann (66) recently cloned another ABC transporter (ABC-C), located in the same chromosomal band as MRPJ, but this is not a MRP homobogue, because the identity between these two proteins is only 18%. After our work was completed Allikmets et a!. (67) reported the identification of 2 1 new ABC genes also based on a search of the human EST database, and they mapped the identified partial sequences. Their new ABC genes also include cMOAT, MRP3, MRP4, MRP5, and MRP6. cMOAT corresponds with EST number 172291, MRP3 with EST number 90757, MRP4 with EST number 205858, MRP5 with EST number 277145, and MRP6 with EST number 349056. EST number 205858 (MRP4) was not mapped by them, but another EST sequence, number 170205, was mapped in the same region as MRP4 and could, therefore, also be MRP4. Their data indicate that MRP4 also encodes a protein with two AlP-binding domains. Possible Physiological Functions of the MRP Family Members. The physiological robe of these new MRP proteins is still unknown, but it is possible that they all play a robe in cellular detoxification processes by exporting GSH S-conjugates or other organic anions, as has been suggested also for MRP1 and cMOAT. GSH S-conjugate carriers have been described in many mammalian cells, including liver, heart, lung, and mast cells and erythrocytes (36, 68). Kinetic studies indicate that both liver canaliculi and erythrocytes contain two different ATP-dependent transport activities for organic anions (69â€” 72). cMOAT is localized in the canalicular membranes of hepato hyperbibirubinemia, like the Dubin-Johnson syndrome, are BRIC and PFIC (Byler disease; Refs. 73 and 74). The clinical and biochemical features of BRIC and PFIC are suggestive of a defect in primary bile acid secretion (75, 76). BRIC and PFIC have both been mapped to the same region on chromosome 18, 18q21-q22 (77, 78). In view of the high expression of MRP3 in the liver (Table 2), MRP3 could be the bile salt transporter and possibly the BRIC/PFIC gene. However, the mapping of MRP3 to chromosome 17 excludes MRP3 from being the BRJC/PFIC gene, although it may still be the bile acid transporter. Because none of the human ABC transporter genes identified thus far maps to chromosome 18 (Ref. 67 and this study), it is unlikely that BRIC/PFIC is caused by a defect in a readily recognizable ABC transporter gene. GS-X activity has also been found in erythrocytes. Several studies have shown that human and rat erythrocytes contain a bow- and a high-affinity DNP-SG transporter (72, 78, 79). The high-affinity DNP-SG transporter is most likely MRP1, because the presence of this protein and its binding to LTC4 have been shown for erythrocytes (80, 81). The other transporter with low affinity for DNP-SG but high affinity for glucuronides and mercapturates (72) is not cMOAT or the bile salt transporter because: (a) no major alterations in DNP-SG transport in erythrocytes from TR rats and Dubin-Johnson patients weredetected(36);and(b)erythrocytetsransporDt NP-SGandGSSG but no bile salts (71). It has to be seen whether this second transporter is encoded by one of the other MRP homologues or another, yet unidentified, gene. Expression of MRP Homologues in Resistant Cell Lines. We screened a large set of cell lines and their resistant sublines to see whether MRPJ, cMOAT, or one of the other MRP homobogues is overexpressed. MRP4 was not overexpressed in any of the lines. MRP3 RNA was only found to be elevated in the cisplatin-resistant HCT8/DDP cell line and several SW1573/S 1 sublines selected for doxorubicin resistance. However, overexpression did not correlate with the level of doxorubicin resistance. For MRP5, only low over expression was found in three cell lines selected for cisplatin resist ance (T24IDDP1O, HCT8IDDP, and KCP-4(â€”); Table 4), but many other cisplatin-sebected cell lines showed no overexpression; there fore, it is questionable whether this low level of MRP5 overexpression has anything to do with cisplatin resistance. Table 3 shows that the classical non-Pgp cell lines selected for high level doxorubicin resistance and known to highly overexpress the MRPJ gene do not significantly overexpress other members of the MRP family. This is compatible with the interpretation that MRP1 is the transporter responsible for MDR in these cell lines. In the non-Pgp derivatives of the SW1573/S1 cell line presented in Table 3, a more complex situation is found, and the contribution of MRP1, cMOAT, MRP3, and the major vault protein, also present at increased bevels in some of these cell lines (82), remains to be sorted out. The Possible Involvement of Organic Anion Transporters in Cisplatin Resistance. Whereas Pgps do not transport small or highly charged molecules, organic anion transporters, such as MRP1 and cMOAT, have been speculatively linked to resistance to oxyanions (arsenite and antimonite) and cisplatin. These compounds can form complexes with GSH, and there is now considerable evidence that these complexes are substrates for organic anion transporters. Resist ance caused by increased export of these complexes is bound to be complex, as pointed out by Ishikawa (68) and by us (8, 11, 83). Increased levels of pump or GSH, increased GSH synthesis, or a combination may be required, depending on the rate-limiting step in drug export. In the protozoal parasite Leishmania, resistance to arsenite and antimonite can be associated with both a 40-fold increase in the Leishmania GSH homologue trypanothione (84) and an increase in the MRP-rebated ABC-transporter PgpA (85). Cancer cells selected for high bevels of cisplatin may sometimes also contain extremely high concentrations of GSH (86), and the GSH synthesis in these cells is up-regulated (86â€”88).All ofthe cisplatin-resistant cell lines studied by us have elevated GSH bevels as well, albeit not as high as the cell lines isolated by Godwin et a!. (86). In contrast to published data, we also find raised GSH bevels in the T24 sublines, the GCT27cisR and PXN94/tetR cell lines (23, 25, 26). We find no clear correlation, however, between the degree of cisplatin resistance and GSH levels, as observed by Godwin et a!. (86). Moreover, all of the cell lines studied by us show a decreased accumulation of cispbatin, and an organic ion pump may, therefore, be involved in resistance. Ishikawa et a!. (17) showed that MRPJ is overexpressed in the cisplatin-resistant human leukemia cell line HL6O/R-CP. They con eluded that an increased GSH synthesis in combination with raised MRP1 levels can cause cisplatin resistance. Active cisplatin efflux has been described in three of the cell lines in Table 4: KCP-4, A2780/ DDP, and HCT8IDDP ( 18â€”20,89). The ATP-dependent efflux was inhibited by DNP-SG, indicating that it was catalyzed by a GS-X pump. In addition, the membrane vesicles of the KCP-4 cell line were shown to catalyze an increased uptake of LTC4 (18, 19), known to be the substrate with the highest affinity for MRPI . However, data from these papers and our study show that MRPJ is not overexpressed in these cisplatin-resistant cell lines, suggesting that MRP1 is not the major pump responsible for cisplatin resistance. This is supported by transfection studies with MRPJ, which showed no cisplatin resistance of the transfected cells (4, 90). Nevertheless, it remains possible that transport of cisplatin conjugates by MRP1 is efficient and that the low levels of MRPI present in parental cells suffice for resistance, if formation of cisplatin conjugates in resistant cells is increased, e.g., by an increase in GSH synthesis. Anorganiacnionpumpthatcouldbeimportanint cisplatirnesist ance is cMOAT. Especially striking is the correlation between cispla tin resistance and cMOAT expression in the non-Pgp MDR cell lines derived from the SW1573/Sl cell line (Table 5). These lines were selected for doxorubicin resistance, and it is, therefore, unlikely that other mechanisms of cisplatin resistance are activated in these lines. It should be noted, however, that these non-Pgp MDR lines, selected for low level doxorubicin resistance, contain multiple alterations in the expression of ABC transporters. Besides up-regulation of MRPJ, cMOAT, and MRP3 (Table 3), down-regulation of MDRJ has oc curred in these lines (Ref. 42, this study, and Table 3). Some other cisplatin-resistant lines contain increased levels of cMOAT as well, notably 2008/Cl3*5.25, 2008/A, A278OIDDP, and HCT8/DDP (Fig. 3; Tables 4 and 5). Clearly, however, cMOAT is not indispensable for cisplatin resistance because some resistant lines do not contain detectable levels of cMOAT (e.g., PXN94/tetR), whereas the KCP-4(+) line even lost its cMOAT when it became highly resistant. The combination of cisplatin with doxorubicin resistance in resist ant cell lines has been reported before (87, 91) and is also present in two other cisplatin-selected lines studied here, PXN94/tetR and KCP 4(â€”) (Table 5). All other cisplatin-selected lines in Table 5 are doxorubicin sensitive, however. There is also no clear correlation between doxorubicin resistance and cMOAT overexpression. This is unexpected. The substrate specificity of the organic anion pumps in the liver canalicular membrane (cMOAT) and in erythrocytes (pre sumably mainly if not exclusively MRP1) is very similar (92). We, therefore, expect both pumps to confer similar resistance spectra. We have recently succeeded in obtaining stably transfected kidney cells in which cMOAT is properly routed to the plasma membrane.8 These cells should allow a direct test of the drug resistance spectrum that can be associated with cMOAT overexpression. Overexpression of cMOAT in cisplatin-resistant cell lines was re cently also reported by Taniguchi et a!. (33). However, in contrast to our results (Table 4), they detected raised cMOAT RNA bevels in the KCP-4 and T24IDDP1Ocell lines. We do not find this. The level of cMOAT RNA was even decreased in the highly cisplatin-resistant KCP-4(+) cells, and in the T24IDDPIO cell line cMOAT RNA is hardly detectable by RNase protection assay. We also detected no cMOAT protein in these cell lines (Fig. 3). Cross-hybridization of the cMOAT probe used by Taniguchi et a!. (33), which contains the coding sequence of the first AlP-binding domain, with RNA tran scribed from the other MRP homologues might explain the discrep ancy. This underlines the importance of the use of gene-specific probes to determine expression of MRP homobogues. In conclusion, our data and those recently published by Ishikawa et a!. (16, 17), Fujii et a!. (18, 19), Goto et a!. (20), Chuman et a!. (89), and Taniguchi et al. (33) provide indirect evidence that an organic anion pump, notably cMOAT, could contribute to cisplatin resistance by exporting the cispbatin-GSH complex. Elevated GSH bevels and synthesis may be required to drive formation of the complex if contact with cisplatin is extended, as is usually the case for cell lines selected for resistance in vitro. However, even in the limited set of cell lines analyzed by us, all chosen for lowered cisplatin accumulation, there was no simple quantitative correla tion between cisplatin resistance and the combination of raised GSH and cMOAT. The picture is, therefore, far from complete. Other resistance mechanisms may contribute to resistance, or the levels of MRP1 and cMOAT deduced from RNase protection assay or immunobbot may insufficiently reflect the ability of these pumps to export the cispbatin-GSH complex. Concluding Remarks. Our analysis underlines the complexity of the alterations that may occur in cells selected for drug resistance. The range of ABC-type transporters that can be (over)expressed in tumor cells is already impressive, and the end is not in sight (67). Although it remainsto be shownthattransportesruschasMRP3â€c”a6n,in principle, contribute to drug resistance, it is already clear that simple correlations between overexpression of a protein and resistance are not sufficient to establish a causal relation. Even gene transfection studies may not always be sufficient to assess the significance of multicomponent systems in resistance. This appears to be the case in resistance mediated by organic anion transporters, as pointed out by Zaman et a!. (11) and Borst and Oueleue (83). An additional complication is the possibility that transporters are rerouted in the cell. Hens et aL (80) have shown that MRP1 is exclusively found in the endosomal compartment of normal epithelial cells, whereas it is mainly in the plasma membrane of cells that overproduce MRP1 (93). Rerouting of MRP1 from endosomes to plasma membrane has even been observed in non-Pgp MDR cells without substantial increase of	Marcel Kool, Marcel de Haa.s, George L. Scheffer, Rik J.

5	1998	A multidrug resistance transporter from human MCF-7 breast cancer cells	ABSTRACT MCF-7yAdrVp is a multidrug-resistant human breast cancer subline that displays an ATP-dependent reduction in the intracellular accumulation of anthracycline anticancer drugs in the absence of overexpression of known multidrug resistance transporters such as P glycoprotein or the multidrug resistance protein. RNA fingerprinting led to the identification of a 2.4-kb mRNA that is overexpressed in MCF-7yAdrVp cells relative to parental MCF-7 cells. The mRNA encodes a 663-aa member of the ATP-binding cassette superfamily of transporters that we term breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Enforced expression of the full-length BCRP cDNA in MCF-7 breast cancer cells confers resistance to mitoxantrone, doxorubicin, and daunorubicin, reduces daunorubicin accumulation and retention, and causes an ATP-dependent enhancement of the efflux of rhodamine 123 in the cloned transfected cells. BCRP is a xenobiotic transporter that appears to play a major role in the multidrug resistance phenotype of MCF-7yAdrVp human breast cancer cells. resistance phenotype of MCF-7yAdrVp human breast cancer cells. The development of resistance to multiple chemotherapeutic drugs occurs frequently during the treatment of advanced carcinoma of the breast. Two transmembrane xenobiotic transporter proteins, P glycoprotein (Pgp) and the multidrug resistance protein (MRP), cause multidrug resistance when transfected into drug-sensitive cells in culture (1–5). Despite these findings, the role these transporters play in clinical drug resistance exhibited by human breast cancer is unclear; hence, alternate or additional drug resistance mechanisms operative in this disease have been sought. To address this problem, Chen et al. (6) selected human breast carcinoma MCF-7 cells for resistance to the anthracycline doxorubicin in the presence of verapamil, an inhibitor of Pgp. The resultant multidrugresistant subline, MCF-7yAdrVp, exhibits marked crossresistance to certain other anthracyclines [daunorubicin and 39- deamino-39-(3-cyano-4-morpholinyl) doxorubicin] and to the anthracenedione mitoxantrone but remains sensitive to vinca alkaloids, paclitaxel (6, 7), and cis-platin. MCF-7yAdrVp cells do not overexpress Pgp or MRP, despite a marked reduction in the intracellular accumulation of the anthracycline daunorubicin and the fluorescent dye rhodamine 123 compared with MCF-7 cells (6, 7). MCF-7yAdrVp cells do not display the altered subcellular distribution of drug (7) seen in certain cells that overexpress MRP. Although the decreased accumulation of daunorubicin is not reversed by the classical Pgp antagonist cyclosporin A, depletion of ATP results in complete abrogation of the enhanced efflux of both daunorubicin and rhodamine (7). These findings led to the hypothesis that an ATPdependent xenobiotic transporter may contribute significantly to the multidrug-resistance phenotype of MCF-7yAdrVp cells. To test this hypothesis, we sought mRNA species that were differentially overexpressed in MCF-7yAdrVp cells compared with MCF-7 cells by using the technique of RNA fingerprinting. MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell Lines. MCF-7 human breast carcinoma cells, their drug-resistant subline MCF-7yAdrVp, and a partial-revertant subline (MCF-7yAdrVpPR), cultured in the absence of adriamycin, were obtained from Antonio Fojo (Medicine Branch, National Cancer Institute). The cells were maintained in culture as described (8). The MCF-7yAdrVp subline was continuously maintained in the presence of 1 mgyml doxorubicin (Pharmacia&Upjohn) and 2.5mgyml verapamil (Sigma). RNA Fingerprinting. RNA Fingerprinting was performed by using the protocol in the Delta RNA Fingerprinting kit (CLONTECH), a modification of the differential-display technique (9, 10). The sequence of the P6 arbitrary primer was 59-ATTAACCCTCACTAAATGCTGGGTG-39; the sequence of the T9 oligo(dT) primer was 59-CATTATGCTGAGTGATATCTTTTTTTTTGG- 39. PCR products that represented differentially expressed cDNAs were excised from the differential-display gels, eluted by boiling in 40 ml of distilled, deionized H2O for 5 min, amplified by PCR for 20 cycles using the original primers, and separated on 2% agaroseyethidium bromide gels to confirm the size of the reamplified product. The reamplified PCR products were ligated into the multiple cloning site of TA cloning vector pCR2.1 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol; after ligation, the vector was transfected into the TOP10F strain of Escherichia coli. Individual bacterial colonies were picked, and plasmid DNA was isolated (Wizard miniprep; Promega). To confirm that the cloned PCR products isolated by TA cloning were overexpressed in the RNA fingerprinting reaction mixture from the drug resistant cells, a ‘‘reverse’’ Northern analysis was performed. Plasmid DNA isolated from 12 different colonies of transfected E. coli was fixed in duplicate to Zeta Probe-GT (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA) membranes in a slot-blot apparatus. One of the duplicate membranes was probed with the 33P-labeled PCR mixture that amplified MCF-7 cDNA by using the original ‘‘P’’ and ‘‘T’’ primers in the RNAFingerprinting kit. The other membrane was probed with the original 33P-labeled parallel PCR reaction mixture that amplified the cDNA produced from MCF-7yAdrVp cells using standard Northern blot conditions of hybridization, after which the binding of probe was assessed by using autoradiography. Construction of cDNA Library. A cDNA library was constructed from MCF-7yAdrVp RNA by using the CapFinder PCR cDNA library construction kit (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The CapFinder technique is designed specifically to produce full-length double-stranded cDNA. The library was screened with the RNA Fingerprinting PCR product of interest by using the manufacturer’s recommended protocol. Positive clones were isolated and subjected to secondary and tertiary screening, with additional testing by Northern blot hybridization using RNA obtained from MCF-7, MCF-7yAdrVp, and MCF-7yAdrVpPR cells. Multiple clones had 2.4-kb inserts, the approximate size of the BCRP mRNA suggested by Northern blotting. Four 2.4-kb inserts were ligated into the pCR2.1 plasmid (see above); sequencing of the 2.4-kb cDNA insert was performed by using an automated DNA sequencer (Perkin–Elmer). All DNA sequences were confirmed by sequencing in the reverse direction. Data Analysis. Analyses of cDNA and deduced protein sequences were accomplished using protein and nucleotidesequence databases that were accessed by using the Wisconsin sequence analysis package, Version 8 (Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI) which are available through the Frederick Cancer Research Center’s Supercomputing Facility (Frederick, MD). Statistical analyses were accomplished with the MINITAB statistical software (MINITAB release 8 extended; Minitab, State College, PA). Reverse Transcription–PCR (RT-PCR). The program OLIGO (Version 5.0; National Biosciences, Plymouth, MN) was used to help determine suitable primers for detection of the human homologue of the Drosophila white gene (w) by RTPCR. The upper primer began at 59 position 2,136 of human w mRNA and had the sequence 59-CGACCGACGACACAGA- 39; the lower primer began at 39 position 2,590 and had the sequence 59-CTTAAAATGAATGCGATTGAT-39. The expected PCR product was 475 bp in length. Random hexamers were used to prime the reverse transcription reaction, which was followed by 25 cycles of PCR. An RT-PCR assay for b-actin was also performed; reaction conditions for this assay have been reported (11). Transfection and Enforced Expression of BCRP in MCF-7 cells. The full-length breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) cDNA was inserted into the multiple cloning site of expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). After the pcDNA3–BCRP construct was sublconed, DNA sequence analysis was performed to confirm the insert of the selected clone was in a sense orientation to the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter of the pcDNA3 vector. MCF-7 cells were transfected with pcDNA3– BCRP by using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (12), selected by culture with geneticin (G418, 1 mgyml), and subcloned by limiting dilution in 96-well flat-bottomed culture plates (Sarstedt, Newton, NC). Subclones were tested for expression of BCRP mRNA by using Northern blot analysis. As a control, MCF-7 cells were also transfected with the empty pcDNA3 vector and selected by growth in medium containing 1 mgyml G418. Pharmacokinetics of Intracellular Drugs and Effect of ATP Depletion. The intracellular accumulation and retention of daunorubicin in MCF-7 cells was determined by using flow cytometry as described (8). Cells cultured in 25-cm2 flasks (Corning Costar) were exposed to 1 mgyml daunorubicin for up to 180 min (accumulation phase) or exposed to daunorubicin for 180 min, washed free of drug with ice-cold saline solution, and resuspended in prewarmed culture medium in the absence of drug (retention phase). At the time intervals indicated in the figure, aliquots of cells were trypsinized off of the plates, and intracellular daunorubicin content was measured (8). Controls for binding of anthracycline to plasma membrane were accomplished by incubating cells with daunorubicin on ice for an appropriate period of time, whereupon cellular daunorubicin content was determined by using flow cytometry. The value for membrane binding was subtracted from the value obtained for intracellular drug content of cells incubated with drug at 37°C. Intracellular drug content is expressed in fluorescence units (FU) per cell. Fluorescence units are arbitrary numbers between 1 and 10,000. Cell volumes were measured by using a Coulter Channelyzer as described (8). MCF-7 cells were depleted of ATP by incubation in glucosefree DMEM containing 50 mM 2-deoxy-D-glucose and 15 mM sodium azide for 20 min (37°C). Rhodamine 123 was added (0.5 mgyml final concentration) for an additional 30 min. The RNA fingerprinting of MCF-7 cells. Total cellular RNA was treated with DNase, reverse-transcribed into cDNA, and amplified by PCR using upstream and downstream primers and radiolabeled [33P]dATP. The figure depicts a portion of the autoradiograph of a 5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the PCR mixture by using the primer pair P6 and T9. Lanes 1, 3, and 5 are reaction mixtures in which cDNA diluted 1:10 was added; lanes 2, 4, and 6 represent reaction mixtures in which cDNA diluted 1:40 was added. Lanes 7 and 8 are H2O controls, in which sterile water was added to the PCR mixture in place of cDNA. Lanes 9, 10, and 11 are RNA controls, in which 0.02 mg of cellular RNA from MCF-7yW, MCF-7yAdrVp, or MCF-7yAdrVpPR cells was added instead of cDNA. These RNA controls served to indicate contamination of the RNA with genomic DNA. The arrow indicates a PCR product representing an mRNA species overexpressed in MCF-7yAdrVp cells, compared with MCF-7yW or MCF-7yAdrVpPR cells. This product was excised from the gel for further amplification by PCR. (B) Northern blot hybridization (Upper) of mRNA from MCF-7yW, MCF-7yAdrVp, or MCF-7yAdrVpPR cells by using the 795-bp PCR product obtained from RNA fingerprinting studies and isolated by TA cloning as a probe after labeling with [32P]dCTP (Prime-a-Gene labeling kit, Promega). To control for equivalence in sample loading, the blot was stripped and rehybridized with a radiolabeled probe for 18S RNA (Lower).  cells were placed on ice, washed free of rhodamine, and incubated under ATP-depleting conditions for an additional 30 min, and rhodamine retention was determined by flow cytometry (excitation 488 nm, emission 520 nm). RESULTS To test the hypothesis outlined in the Introduction, we employed the technique of RNA fingerprinting, a modification of the method of differential display that uses PCR and degenerate- primer pairs to amplify cellular mRNA. For the PCR reactions, cDNA was prepared from MCF-7, MCF-7yAdrVp, and MCF-7yAdrVpPR cells, the latter of which have partially reverted to drug sensitivity by culture in the absence of selecting agents. When RNA fingerprinting was performed with the primers P6 and T9, a PCR product was found reproducibly in excess in reactions that used cDNA from MCF-7yAdrVp cells as template, compared with those reactions with cDNA from MCF-7 or MCF-7yAdrVpPR cells (Fig. 1A). The PCR product overexpressed in MCF-7yAdrVp cells was excised from the dried gel, purified, and ligated into a TA cloning vector. Screening of the TA vector clones by the reverse Northern blot method led to the isolation of a single clone whose PCR product insert identified, by standard Northern analysis, a 2.4-kb mRNA species that was markedly overexpressed in MCF-7yAdrVp cells, compared with MCF-7 (Fig. 1B, Top). The partially revertant MCF-7yAdrVpPR subline had intermediate expression of the 2.4-kb mRNA species (Fig. 1B). The differentially expressed PCR product in the TA clone was sequenced and found to be a 795-bp cDNA. Protein database searches of the deduced amino acid sequence revealed a high degree of homology to members of the ATPbinding cassette (ABC) family of transport proteins. The 795-bp cDNA fragment was radiolabeled and used as a probe to screen a cDNA library prepared from MCF-7yAdrVp cells. A clone of l bacteriophage containing a 2.4-kb cDNA fragment was identified and isolated. The cDNA insert was completely sequenced and found to be 2,418 bp in length. Analysis of the cDNA for ORFs using the program FRAMES contained in the GCG software package indicated the presence of a long ORF that began at position 239 and ended with the stop codon TAA at position 2,204–2,206. The deduced amino acid sequence of this ORF is shown in Fig. 2A. The protein encoded by this sequence has been designated breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). A comparison of the BCRP amino acid sequence using the GCG software FASTA revealed a high degree of homology to at least 50 ABC transport proteins. The highest match was PIR2:G02068, the human homologue of the Drosophila white (w) gene, which has 638 amino acids and is 29.3% identical to BCRP. The w gene in Drosophila functions in the cellular transport of guanine and tryptophan, which are retinal-pigment precursors (13–16). The human homologue of w (17) is not overexpressed in MCF-7y AdrVp cells compared with MCF-7 cells as detected by an RT-PCR assay (data not shown). Analysis of the BCRP peptide sequence with the GCG program MOTIFS demonstrated a single Walker ‘‘A’’ ATPy GTP binding region (18) at amino acids 88–95 and a phosphopantetheine attachment site at amino acids 221–236 (Fig. 2A). As the prosthetic group of acyl carrier proteins in some multienzyme complexes, phosphopantetheine serves in the attachment of activated fatty acid and amino acid groups (19). Examination of BCRP structure with GCG programs PEPPLOT and PLOTSTRUCTURE revealed a relatively hydrophilic amino-terminal domain (amino acids 1–400) that contains the ATP-binding sequence and a relatively hydrophobic carboxylterminal domain (amino acids 401–663) containing at least three putative transmembrane domains and four potential N-glycosylation sites (Fig. 2A). The transmembrane domains were estimated with a program to predict helices in integral membrane proteins (20). Analysis of the BCRP sequence by the GCG program DOTPLOT demonstrated that the peptide is homologous with one-half of the duplicated Pgp or MRP molecule, except that Pgp or MRP have the configuration NH2-[transmembrane domains]-[ATP binding 1]-[transmembrane domains]-[ATP binding 2]-COOH, whereas BCRP is NH2-[ATP binding]-[transmembrane domains]-COOH. The phylogenetic relationship of BCRP to other members of the ABC transporter superfamily was determined by using the GCG programs PILEUP, DISTANCES, and GROWTREE. This analysis revealed BCRP is only distantly related to Pgp orMRP (Fig. 2B). The BCRP cDNA was used as a probe in Northern blots to examine the expression of BCRP mRNA in selected normal human tissues (Fig. 3). The greatest expression was seen in placental tissue with considerably lower levels of expression in brain, prostate, small intestine, testis, ovary, colon, and liver. BCRP transcripts were below the level of detection in heart, lung, skeletal muscle, kidney, pancreas, spleen, thymus, and peripheral-blood leukocytes. To evaluate BCRP function in vitro, the full-length cDNA was inserted into the multiple cloning site of the expression vector pcDNA3. MCF-7 cells were transfected with the vector containing the full-length BCRP cDNA (pcDNA3–BCRP) or with the empty vector as a control. After selection with geneticin (G418), the pcDNA3–BCRP-transfected cells were cloned by using limiting dilution; multiple clones were tested for BCRP expression by using Northern blot hybridization (Fig. 4A). Two BCRP-overexpressing clones (clones 6 and 8) and one clone that did not overexpress BCRP (clone 19) were selected for studies of BCRP function in comparison to cells transfected only with empty vector and to parental MCF-7 cells. The expression of BCRP mRNA in clone 6 was less than in clone 8 (Fig. 4A). Daunorubicin accumulation and retention were examined in transfected cells by using flow cytometry. The BCRPoverexpressing clones 6 and 8 reproducibly displayed diminished accumulation and retention of daunorubicin when compared with the vector-transfected controls (Fig. 4B). The intracellular steady-state concentrations of daunorubicin in clones 8 and 6, respectively, were approximately 30% or 50% of that attained in the vector control cells. This was not the result of differences in cell volume, because the volumes of the BCRP-overexpressing sublines tested were not lower than the empty vector-transfected control cells. In previous studies (8), the intracellular steady-state accumulation of daunorubicin in MCF-7yAdrVp cells was approximately 25% of that in MCF- 7yW cells, which is comparable to the accumulation of daunorubicin that we observed in transfectant clone 8 in the current studies. The transport function of BCRP appears to depend on ATP (Fig. 4C). The intracellular retention of rhodamine 123 in BCRP-overexpressing clone-8 cells was diminished to 45% of that of vector control cells. Depletion of ATP increased rhodamine retention in clone 8 cells to levels comparable to those of vector control cells cultured in complete medium but had no effect on the rhodamine retention in the vector control cells (Fig. 4C). The sensitivities of the various transfected sublines to chemotherapeutic agents were tested by the sulforhodamine-B cytotoxicity assay (21). The BCRP-overexpressing clones 6 and 8 displayed resistance to mitoxantrone, daunorubicin, and doxorubicin compared with non-BCRP-overexpressing clone 19 cells, MCF-7 cells, or the empty vector-transfected controls (Table 1; Fig. 4D). Like MCF-7yAdrVp cells, the MCF-7y BCRP transfectant clones 6 and 8 displayed the greatest degree of resistance to mitoxantrone. The pattern of crossresistance displayed by the BCRP-overexpressing transfected cells is very similar to the pattern displayed by MCF-7yAdrVp cells; however, MCF-7yAdrVp cells have a greater relative resistance to all cytotoxic drugs within the phenotype. The BCRP-overexpressing clones 6 and 8 are sensitive to cis-platin, paclitaxel, and vincristine, as are MCF-7yAdrVp cells (Table 1). BCRP transfectant clone 19, which did not overexpress BCRP, met the minimal statistical criterion (P 5 0.0497) for significance of a low degree of resistance to cis-platin (resistance factor 5 2.7) in comparison to MCF-7yW but not in comparison to cells transfected with the empty vector (MCF- 7ypcDNA3; see Table 1). With this exception, the sensitivity of clone 19 was not statistically different from MCF-7yW or MCF-7ypcDNA3 for the drugs tested. DISCUSSION The data presented here strongly support the conclusion that the novel ABC-transport protein family member BCRP is an ATP-dependent xenobiotic transporter that plays a major role in the drug-resistance phenotype of MCF-7yAdrVp cells. The overexpression of BCRP mRNA in MCF-7yAdrVp cells, which is diminished in MCF-7yAdrVpPR, suggests an important role for BCRP in resistance to cytotoxic agents. Furthermore, the enforced overexpression of BCRP in MCF-7 cells diminished daunorubicin cellular accumulation and imparted a pattern of drug crossresistance to the transfected cells that was virtually identical to that of MCF-7yAdrVp cells. The degree of BCRP overexpression in transfectant clones 6 and 8 mitoxantrone, daunorubicin, and doxorubicin. A major difference between the BCRP-overexpressing transfectant clones and the original MCF-7yAdrVp subline is that the degree of drug resistance in the latter is greater than in the transfected cells; however, the steady-state BCRP mRNA levels in the transfectants are comparable to those of MCF-7yAdrVp cells (Fig. 4A). A number of possibilities may contribute to this difference. Alterations in protein stability, localization, or both may contribute to the full drug-resistant phenotype, or the expression of other proteins may be required. Recently, we reported members of the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) family, primarily the nonspecific crossreacting antigen and CEA itself, are markedly overexpressed on the cell surface of MCF-7yAdrVp and MCF-7yAdrVpPR cells compared with drug-sensitive MCF-7 cells (22). A high density of these acidic glycoproteins on the cell surface may protonate drugs such as mitoxantrone, daunorubicin, or doxorubicin, which will prevent entry into the cell. Indeed, Kawaharata et al. (23) reported that the enforced expression of CEA in transfected NIH 3T3 cells resulted in both diminished accumulation of and resistance to doxorubicin in the transfected cells. Hence, the relative overexpression of CEA family members on the MCF-7yAdrVp cell surface could act in concert with BCRP to cause greater resistance to mitoxantrone, doxorubicin, and daunorubicin than could BCRP alone. This hypothesis could be tested by cotransfecting the MCF-7yBCRP-clone 8 subline with an expression vector containing the nonspecific cross-reacting antigen or CEA. Another possible explanation for the greater degree of resistance of MCF-7yAdrVp cells compared with the transfectants is that BCRP may participate in a multiprotein transporter complex. The translocation pathway of typical ABC transporters consists of two ATP-binding domains and two highly hydrophobic domains that contain membranespanning regions. This configuration can be accomplished in a single large molecule (e.g., MRP or Pgp). Alternatively, the active complex of certain ABC transporters can be formed by the heterodimerization of two nonidentical proteins, each containing a single ATP-binding and hydrophobic region. The w and brown (b) proteins of Drosophila and the Tap-1 and Tap-2 proteins that transport major histocompatibility class I peptides are examples of ABC-transport protein family members that exhibit such a cooperative interaction. The presence of the phosphopantetheine attachment site on BCRP suggests that BCRP may be part of a multiprotein complex. Possibly BCRP has one or more protein cofactors that function as a much more efficient transporter in a heteromeric state. The activation or overexpression of this cofactor in MCF-7yAdrVp relative to MCF-7 cells could explain the greater drug resistance in the MCF-7yAdrVp subline relative to the BCRP transfectants.

6	2002	MULTIDRUG RESISTANCE IN CANCER: ROLE OF ATP-DEPENDENT TRANSPORTERS	Chemotherapeutics are the most effective treatment for metastatic tumours. However, the ability of cancer cells to become simultaneously resistant to different drugs — a trait known as multidrug resistance — remains a significant impediment to successful chemotherapy. Three decades of multidrug-resistance research have identified a myriad of ways in which cancer cells can elude chemotherapy, and it has become apparent that resistance exists against every effective drug, even our newest agents. Therefore, the ability to predict and circumvent drug resistance is likely to improve chemotherapy. Patients who have cancer that does not respond to local excision or radiation (about 50% of total cancer cases), and patients with haematological malignancies, are treated with chemotherapy, immunotherapy and biological- response modifiers. But why can some patients be cured by these approaches and others respond transiently or incompletely? Host and tumour genetic alterations, epigenetic changes and tumour environment all seem to contribute to the complex story of cancer drug resistance1. Cellular mechanisms of multidrug resistance There are two general classes of resistance to anticancer drugs: those that impair delivery of anticancer drugs to tumour cells, and those that arise in the cancer cell itself due to genetic and epigenetic alterations that affect drug sensitivity. Impaired drug delivery can result from poor absorption of orally administered drugs, increased drug metabolism or increased excretion, resulting in lower levels of drug in the blood and reduced diffusion of drugs from the blood into the tumour mass2,3. Recent studies have emphasized the importance of the tumour vasculature and an appropriate pressure gradient for adequate drug delivery to the tumour4. In addition, some cancer cells that are sensitive to chemotherapy as monolayer cells in culture become resistant when transplanted into animal models5. This indicates that environmental factors, such as the extracellular matrix or tumour geometry, might be involved in drug resistance. Cancer cells grown in culture as three-dimensional spheroids, mimicking their in vivo geometry, have also been shown to become resistant to cancer drugs2,5,6. Much remains to be learned about this type of drug resistance and its role in clinical oncology. Cellular mechanisms of drug resistance have been intensively studied, as experimental models can be easily generated by in vitro selection with cytotoxic agents. Cancer cells in culture can become resistant to a single drug, or a class of drugs with a similar mechanism of action, by altering the drug’s cellular target or by increasing repair of drug-induced damage, frequently to DNA. After selection for resistance to a single drug, cells might also show cross-resistance to other structurally and mechanistically unrelated drugs — a phenomenon that is known as MULTIDRUG RESISTANCE.This might explain why treatment regimens that combine multiple agents with different targets are not more effective. As illustrated in FIG. 1, different types of cellular multidrug resistance have been described.Resistance to natural-product hydrophobic drugs — sometimes known as classical multidrug resistance — generally results from expression of ATP-dependent efflux pumps with broad drug specificity. These pumps belong to a family of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters that share sequence and structural homology. So far, 48 human ABC genes have been identified and divided into seven distinct subfamilies (ABCA–ABCG) on the basis of their sequence homology and domain organization7. Resistance results because increased drug efflux lowers intracellular drug concentrations. Drugs that are affected by classical multidrug resistance include the VINCA ALKALOIDS (vinblastine and vincristine), the ANTHRACYCLINES (doxorubicin and daunorubicin), the RNA transcription inhibitor actinomycin-D and the microtubule-stabilizing drug paclitaxel8. Resistance can also be mediated by reduced drug uptake.Water-soluble drugs that ‘piggyback’ on transporters and carriers that are used to bring nutrients into the cell, or agents that enter by means of endocytosis, might fail to accumulate without evidence of increased efflux. Examples include the antifolate methotrexate, nucleotide analogues, such as 5-fluorouracil and 8-azaguanine, and cisplatin9,10. Multidrug resistance can also result from activation of coordinately regulated detoxifying systems, such as DNA repair and the CYTOCHROME P450 mixedfunction oxidases. Indeed, coordinate induction of the multidrug transporter P-glycoprotein (PGP) and cytochrome P450 3A has been observed11. This type of multidrug resistance can be induced after exposure to any drug. Recent evidence indicates that certain orphan nuclear receptors, such as SXR, might be involved in mediating this global response to environmental stress12. Finally, resistance can result from defective apoptotic pathways. This might occur as a result of malignant transformation; for example, in cancers with mutant or non-functional p53 (REF. 158). Alternatively, cells might acquire changes in apoptotic pathways during exposure to chemotherapy, such as alteration of ceramide levels13 or changes in cell-cycle machinery, which activate checkpoints and prevent initiation of apoptosis. An important principle in multidrug resistance is that cancer cells are genetically heterogeneous. Although the process that results in uncontrolled cell growth in cancer favours clonal expansion, tumour cells that are exposed to chemotherapeutic agents will be selected for their ability to survive and grow in the presence of cytotoxic drugs. These cancer cells are likely to be genetically heterogeneous because of the mutator phenotype. So, in any population of cancer cells that is exposed to chemotherapy,more than one mechanism ofmultidrug resistance can be present. This phenomenon has been called MULTIFACTORIAL MULTIDRUG RESISTANCE. ATP-dependent transporters Selection of cancer cells in culture with natural-product anticancer drugs, such as paclitaxel, doxorubicin, or vinblastine, frequently results in multidrug resistance that is due to expression of the ABC transporter PGP, the product of the ABCB1 (or MDR1) gene14,15. PGP is a broad-spectrum multidrug efflux pump that has 12 transmembrane regions and two ATP-binding sites16 (FIG. 2). The transmembrane regions bind hydrophobic drug substrates that are either neutral or positively charged, and are probably presented to the transporter directly from the lipid bilayer8. Two ATP hydrolysis events, which do not occur simultaneously, are needed to transport one drug molecule17. Binding Multidrug resistance of cancer cells is a potentially surmountable obstacle to effective chemotherapy of cancer. • ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, including MDR1 (ABCB1),MRP1 (ABCC1) and ABCG2, can confer multidrug resistance to cancer cells in vitro. •MRP2 (ABCC2), MRP3 (ABCC3), MRP4 (ABCC4), MRP5 (ABCC5),ABCA2 and BSEP (ABCB11) are capable of transporting drugs; future studies are needed to determine a role in drug resistance. • ABC transporters such as MDR1 and MRP1 are expressed in many human cancers, including leukaemias and some solid tumours; in some studies, expression of these transporters has been shown to correlate with response to therapy and survival. • Inhibitors of ABC transporters such as MDR1/P-glycoprotein have been tested in clinical trials with a suggestion of benefit, especially in acute myelogenous leukaemia. • Interpretation of clinical trials using inhibitors of MDR1/P-glycoprotein has been confounded by their effects on the pharmacokinetics of anticancer drugs. • Development of inhibitors of ABC transporters should focus on potency and specificity to minimize unexpected pharmacokinetic effects. • Efficacy should be confirmed using surrogate assays. • Normal tissues might be protected from toxicity by gene transfer of drug-resistance genes. • Prevention of ABC transporter induction in cancer cells might help to avert drug resistance. of substrate to the transmembrane regions stimulates the ATPase activity of PGP, causing a conformational change that releases substrate to either the outer leaflet of the membrane (from which it can diffuse into the medium) or the extracellular space18. Hydrolysis at the second ATP site seems to be required to ‘re-set’ the transporter so that it can bind substrate again, completing one catalytic cycle19. PGP efficiently removes cytotoxic drugs and many commonly used pharmaceuticals from the lipid bilayer. Its broad substrate specificity presumably reflects a large, polymorphous drug-binding domain or domains within the transmembrane segments. Because PGP binds many different hydrophobic compounds, it has been easy to find potent PGP inhibitors.Two inhibitors that are used in the laboratory and in clinical trials that attempted to reverse drug resistance are the calcium channel blocker verapamil and the immunosuppressant cyclosporin A. As not all multidrug-resistant cells express PGP, a search for other efflux pumps was initiated, leading to the discovery of the multidrug-resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1, or ABCC1)20. MRP1 is similar to PGP in structure, with the exception of an aminoterminal extension that contains five-membranespanning domains attached to a PGP-like core (FIG. 2). MRP1 recognizes neutral and anionic hydrophobic natural products, and transports glutathione and other conjugates of these drugs, or, in some cases — such as for vincristine — co-transports unconjugated glutathione21–23. The discovery of MRP1 stimulated a genomic search for homologues, leading to the discovery of eight additional members of the ABCC subfamily of transporters, of which six have been studied in some detail24. Like MRP1, some of these MRPs have the fivetransmembrane amino-terminal extension (ABCC2, ABCC3 and ABCC6, also named MRP2, 3, and 6), whereas others do not.Many MRP family members transport drugs in model systems and therefore have the potential to confer drug resistance24. Some anticancer drugs, such as mitoxantrone, are poor substrates for MDR1 and MRP1. Selection for mitoxantrone resistance results in multidrug-resistant cells that produce a more distant member of the ABC transporter family, ABCG2 — also known as MXR (mitoxantrone-resistance gene), BCRP (breast cancer resistance protein) or ABC-P (ABC transporter in placenta)25–27. This transporter is thought to be a homodimer of two half-transporters, each containing an ATP-binding domain at the amino-terminal end of the molecule and six transmembrane segments (FIG. 2). The first two original ABCG2 genes that were cloned from resistant cells encoded proteins with either a threonine or glycine substituted for arginine at amino acid 482, giving them much broader substrate specificity, including the ability to transport doxorubicin28,29. This finding, together with many well-documented mutations in PGP, shows that even single amino-acid substitutions can change substrate specificity8. Other ABC family members have been associated with drug resistance. For example, the bile salt export protein (BSEP, also known as ABCB11), first reported as the ‘sister of PGP’ (SPGP), is expressed at high levels in liver cells, and in transfection experiments it confers lowlevel resistance to paclitaxel30.MDR3 (sometimes called MDR2), a phosphatidylcholine FLIPPASE that is closely related to PGP, normally transports phospholipids into bile, but can transport paclitaxel and vinblastine, albeit inefficiently unless it is mutated31–33. Finally, ABCA2 is overexpressed in estramustine-resistant cells7,34,35. Estramustine is a nitrogen mustard derivative of oestradiol, so ABCA2 — which is expressed intracellularly in endosomal/lysosomal vesicles — might participate in steroid transport. Although the lung resistance protein (LRP) is not an ABC transporter, it is frequently included in discussions of drug resistance, as it is expressed at high levels in drug-resistant cell lines and some tumours36. LRP is a major vault protein found in the cytoplasm and on the nuclear membrane.Vaults are large ribonucleoprotein particles that are present in all eukaryotic cells. Their shape is reminiscent of the nucleopore central plug, and the major vault proteins account for 70% of their mass. Although their role in normal physiology is not yet established, vaults might confer drug resistance by redistributing drugs away from intracellular ABC transporters have an important role in regulating central nervous system permeability. The brain is protected against blood-borne toxins by the blood– brain barrier (BBB), and the blood–cerebrospinal-fluid (CSF) barrier. The BBB is formed by the endothelial cells of capillaries, with PGP located on the luminal surface, preventing the penetration of cytotoxins across the endothelium49,50. MRP proteins such as MRP1 are localized to the basolateral membrane of the choroid plexus, where they serve to pump the metabolic waste products of CSF into the blood51. ABC transporters also seem to protect testicular tissue and the developing fetus in a similar manner. In the testis, as in the brain, PGP transports toxins into the capillary lumen. MRP1, on the other hand, is localized on the basolateral surface of Sertoli cells, protecting sperm within the testicular tubules. In the placenta, PGP is localized on the apical syncytiotrophoblast surface, where it can protect the fetus from toxic cationic xenobiotics52. MRP family members and the half- transporter ABCG2 are also localized in placenta53,54. MRP1 and other isoforms might be involved in protecting fetal blood from toxic organic anions and excreting glutathione/glucuronide metabolites into the maternal circulation55. Whereas ABC transporters are expressed in the brain, testis and placenta to protect these ‘sanctuaries’ from cytotoxins, the liver, gastrointestinal tract and kidney use them to excrete toxins, protecting the entire organism. PGP is localized in the apical membranes of hepatocytes, where it transports toxins into bile56. In humans,MRP3 is localized to the basolateral surface of hepatocytes, where it transports organic anions from liver back into the bloodstream57.A similar role might exist for MRP6, which has been found to be expressed at high levels by liver cells58. MRP2 (cMOAT) is also localized on the apical surface of hepatocytes, where it transports BILIRUBIN-glucuronide and other organic anions into bile59.Mutations that disrupt MRP2 function cause bilirubin accumulation and jaundice in rats60,61 and in patients with Dubin– Johnson syndrome62,63.Mutations in BSEP are associated with progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type-2, which is characterized by reduced secretion of bile salts and hepatic failure64,65. Finally, MDR2 functions as a phosphatidylcholine trans-locase, which reduces the toxicity of bile salts66. Loss of MDR2 function results in progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type-3 (REFS 31, 67). In the gastrointestinal tract, PGP is localized in apical membranes of mucosal cells, where it extrudes toxins, forming a first line of defence. Increased tissue concentrations of PGP substrates in Mdr1a/Mdr1b-knockout mice indicate that PGP might have a significant role in determining oral drug bioavailability. Studies have shown increased tissue absorption of putative PGP substrates following oral administration when a PGP inhibitor is administered concurrently68–70.Additionally, PGP actively secretes intravenously administered drugs into the gastrointestinal tract71. In contrast to PGP, MRP1 is located in the basolateral membrane of mucosal cells, and therefore transports substrates into the interstitium and the bloodstream, rather than across the apical surface into the intestinal lumen72.Consistent with the absence of expression on the apical surface, Mrp1-null mice have not been found to have alterations in drug pharmacokinetics73. MRP2, on the other hand, localizes to the CANALICULAR MEMBRANE of hepatocytes and the apical surface of epithelial cells, and has a primary role in the excretion of bilirubin-glucuronide. Studies confirmed that MRP2 was capable of mediating drug efflux, and a recent study showed increased bioavailability of a food-derived carcinogen — 2-amino-1-methyl- 6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b] pyridine — in Mrp2-null rats74. This indicates that MRP2, like PGP, might also regulate drug bioavailability. ABC transporters in human cancers Although it seems likely that cancer cells use several different types of ABC transporter to gain drug resistance power to draw reliable conclusions77. One problem with designing a study that provides statistically valid results is that methods for detecting PGP expression are imperfect. This is primarily due to the lack of specificity of many commonly used anti-PGP antibodies.To complicate matters, researchers also use different methods to quantify expression, to control for tumour heterogeneity, and to account for the presence of normal tissue in tumour biopsies78.Despite efforts to bring uniformity to PGP quantification, it is still difficult to discern valid from invalid data. Expression of MRP1 has also been analysed in clinical samples.Antibodies against MRP1 seem to be more specific than those that recognize PGP79, and MRP1 is highly expressed in leukaemias, oesophageal carcinoma and non-small-cell lung cancers80.Conclusions about expression levels of other ABC transporters in human tissue await more extensive analysis. Leukaemia. The most uniform associations between MDR1/PGP expression and drug resistance have been reported in acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML). PGP expression has been reported in leukaemic cells from about one-third of patients with AML at the time of diagnosis, and more than 50% of patients at relapse; higher levels occur in certain subtypes, including secondary leukaemias81–83. PGP expression is correlated with a reduced complete remission rate, and a higher incidence of refractory disease — a surprising finding, as treatment regimens include not only the PGP substrate daunorubicin, but also AraC, which is not a PGP substrate81,84–86. Recent studies report that PGP expression is associated with a poorer prognosis, although the magnitude of the effects on response and survival is probably not as great as initially thought. These clinical results are supported by ex vivo studies of leukaemic cells, which have shown that PGP expression reduces ABC transporters in human cancers Although it seems likely that cancer cells use several different types of ABC transporter to gain drug resistance, most clinical studies have focused on PGP. Early studies showed that PGP was highly expressed in colon, kidney, adrenocortical and hepatocellular cancers75,76. Initially, there was hope that increases in PGP expression alone could explain cancer drug resistance.However, the failure of these cancers to respond to drugs that are not PGP substrates indicated that other factors are involved, and attention turned to cancers that acquire resistance following chemotherapy. In seeking to define the role of PGP in drug resistance, researchers have assumed that PGP expression is highest in tumours that are dependent on expression for survival, that expression impairs response to chemotherapy, and that expression levels increase as tumours become drug resistant.On the basis of these assumptions, clinical trials aimed at increasing chemotherapy sensitivity in drug-resistant tumours, through inhibition of PGP, have been implemented. So, does PGP expression confer drug resistance in human cancer? Most studies that correlate PGP expression with clinical outcome have been small of breast tumours expressed PGP92. PGP expression increased after therapy and was associated with a greater likelihood of treatment failure.However, there was considerable interstudy variability — a finding that has persisted in the reports since 1996 (REFS 93,96,97,159–161), preventing a solid conclusion about the role of PGP in breast cancer. Recent imaging studies using 99mTc (technetium)-sestamibi (Cardiolite), a transport substrate recognized by PGP, indicate that its activity is increased in breast carcinomas93–95. Whether the MRP1 expression levels associated with breast cancer are enough to confer drug resistance is not yet resolved96,97.As MRP1 is expressed ubiquitously, it is not surprising that using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT—PCR), MRP1 mRNA can be detected in all breast cancer samples at levels comparable to that in normal tissues. One immunohistochemical analysis of a series of resected invasive primary breast carcinomas reported a correlation between relapse-free survival and MRP1 expression98. Other solid tumours.Variability in expression is also a problem for other solid tumours. In ovarian cancer samples, 16–47% were found to express PGP, as measured by immunohistochemistry162–164.Critical analysis of these data reveals that PGP is expressed by only about 20% of ovarian cancers when samples were taken at diagnosis. This makes it difficult to demonstrate a correlation between expression and outcomes, such as disease- free survival, particularly given the importance of cisplatin in therapy. In lung cancer samples, MDR1 mRNA cisplatin in therapy. In lung cancer samples, MDR1 mRNA expression was reported to be increased in 15–50% of tumours99–101. The incidence of MRP1 expression is much higher (about 80%) in small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) samples. MRP1 expression was detected in 100% of non-smallcell lung cancers (NSCLC),with higher levels noted in 30% of the samples — this might not be surprising, given its ubiquitous expression in normal lung tissue101,102. Immunohistochemical studies confirmed the predominantly plasma-membrane localization pattern of MRP1 (REF. 103).Given the low levels of MDR1 expression and the nearly ubiquitous expression of MRP1,lung cancer should be an excellent model in which to evaluate the role of MRP1-specific inhibitors. Sarcomas represent another malignancy in which PGP expression seems to be important for drug resistance. Immunohistochemical studies of both soft-tissue sarcomas and osteosarcomas revealed a strong association between PGP expression, relapse-free survival and overall survival104,105.Other methodologies, however, have been used to substantiate and refute these findings, and there has been no consensus regarding the effect of PGP on survival in sarcomas106–110. Reversal of drug resistance in cancer Since the early 1980s, many agents have been investigated for their ability to reverse PGP-mediated multidrug resistance in cancer patients. Examples include verapamil, the phenothiazines, quinidine, quinacrine, quinine, amiodarone, several neuroleptics, tamoxifen, progesterone, cyclosporin A, dexverapamil, dexniguldipine, GF-902128, PSC-833 and VX-710. Agents already in use for other indications, but discovered to also inhibit PGP,were tested in the first clinical trials. Early speculation was replaced by reality as these agents were found to be weak inhibitors that were toxic at high doses111. In subsequent trials — most notably those with cyclosporin A and dexverapamil — it became clear that surrogate markers would be needed to evaluate efficacy. It has also become clear that a number of complications arise in treating cancer patients with these types of drug. Excellent reviews cataloguing completed trials are available111–115. Toxicity. The potential for bone-marrow and neurological toxicity were of concern when trials with PGP inhibitors were launched. Previous studies had shown that PGP was expressed and ‘active’ in haematopoietic stem cells116, and the discovery that PGP functioned at the BBB led to concern that inhibitors might damage the central nervous system. In support of this, the concentration of PGP substrates were increased in the central nervous systems ofMdr1a- and Mdr1b-null mice49.Clinical findings did not, however, validate these concerns. Although MYELOSUPPRESSION has been observed in patients treated with PGP inhibitors, it is more likely to be caused by a pharmacokinetic interaction than by toxicity to stem cells.Very little toxicity to the central nervous system has been reported in patients treated with PGP inhibitors — even with known neurotoxic compounds, such as the TAXANES or vinca alkaloids117. CEREBELLAR ATAXIA has been described in patients treated with PSC-833, tamoxifen or dexniguldipine administered alone115. It is unclear, however, if this ataxia occurs by inhibition of PGP at the blood–brain barrier. A large number of trials have been conducted in patients with AML. Compared with historial controls, non-randomized trials showed an improved response in patients with relapsed or refractory AML, older patients with AML, and patients with MYELODYSPLASTIC SYNDROME who developed AML118–122. In one study, quinine treatment increased the complete response rate and disease-free survival in patients with PGP-positive leukaemic cells, but not in those with PGP-negative cells122. In addition, a large prospective randomized study of AML patients reported an increase in relapsefree and overall survival for patients receiving cyclosporin A123. Similar observations were made in patients with other PGP-expressing malignancies124,125. Pharmacokinetic interactions. Interpretation of clinical trials involving inhibitors of MDR1/PGP has been confounded by their effects on the pharmacokinetics of anticancer drugs. Because PGP inhibitors increase serum levels of anticancer drugs112,113, researchers reduced the doses of anticancer drugs given to patients. The hope was that these dose reductions would result in similar drug concentrations.However, two studies administering paclitaxel in combination with PSC-833 found that a significant fraction of patients were undertreated177,126. Further evidence for XR-9576, an anthranilic-acid-based drug, is a potent inhibitor of P-glycoprotein without apparent pharmacokinetic interaction. In clinical studies, a single intravenous dose completely inhibits rhodamine efflux from CD56+ circulating cells for up to 72 hours, consistent with the observation that it is not a substrate for P-glycoprotein-mediated transport; and so might be expected to have a longer duration of action153. R-101933 is a benzazepine derivative being developed as an oral P-glycoprotein inhibitor. In vitro studies have shown that the main metabolic pathway is not dependent on the cytochrome P450 CYP3A4,whereas clinical studies have found no effect on docetaxel pharmacokinetics. LY-335979 is a potent inhibitor that contains a cyclopropyldibenzosuberane moiety. Although the affinity of P-glycoprotein for LY-335979 is high, as with XR-9576, LY-335979 does not seem to be a substrate for P-glycoprotein.Clinical studies indicate that LY-335979 lacks significant pharmacokinetic interaction with plasma levels of doxorubicin, etoposide or paclitaxel154,155. OC-1440935 is a substituted diarylimidazole that was generated using combinatorial chemistry and high-throughput cell-based screening. Similar to the other, newer agents, it is highly potent, and does not seem to be a P-glycoprotein substrate.Pre-clinical studies indicate that it is orally bioavailable, lacks a pharmacokinetic interaction with plasma paclitaxel and does not inhibit CYP3A4. GF-120918, an acridinecarboxamide derivative, fully reverses P-glycoproteinmediated resistance at concentrations as low as 30 nM156 with a half-maximal inhibition at 50 nM157, and has a minor effect on pharmacokinetics, except at very high modulator and doxorubicin levels, albeit with a more pronounced effect on doxorubicinol pharmacokinetics133. It can also block the half-transporter BCRP/ underdosing can also be inferred from other trials83,119,127. If these are representative of most studies, and there is no reason to believe otherwise, it indicates that a significant fraction of patients have been underdosed. In a disease such as AML, this would have adverse consequences. Furthermore, another fraction of patients were probably overdosed, increasing the morbidity and mortality in those individuals receiving the PGP inhibitor. The pharmacokinetic complications associated with PGP inhibitors might be due to the fact that they inhibit other proteins involved in drug metabolism, such as cytochrome P450.Or, for example, PSC-833 and cyclosporin A inhibit BSEP and reduce the secretion of bile salts, so they might reduce bile flow and slow hepatic excretion of chemotherapeutic agents128. Pharmacokinetic interactions seem to be most pronounced in patients treated with PSC-833 and cyclosporin A117,118,126,129,130, although they have been reported in patients treated with verapamil, dexverapamil, nifedipine and VX- 710 (REFS 112,131,132,165). The effect varies depending on the anticancer drug used in conjunction with the inhibitor, or even whether the parent drug or a metabolite is administered115,132–135. After nearly 15 years and dozens of studies111,113–115, there is no definitive answer to the question: can a PGP inhibitor effectively reverse drug resistance in humans? The pharmacokinetic interactions observed with these agents have made it difficult to interpret efficacy. PGP inhibitors with fewer pharmacokinetic interactions are being developed, and surrogates are being used to determine the optimal dose The primary goal of clinical trials has been to reverse existing drug resistance. A trial approach that has not been thoroughly examined is one that aims to prevent the emergence of drug resistance. In the laboratory, selection of resistant cells usually begins with low drug concentrations, which are then gradually advanced. Using high concentrations at the outset markedly reduces the number of resistant clones that are isolated. Because drug transporters effectively reduce drug exposure, they can facilitate development of drug resistance without themselves conferring high levels of resistance. So, a potentially effective strategy to prevent the emergence of drug resistance is to increase the intracellular concentration of chemotherapeutic agents by administering a transport inhibitor at the beginning of treatment. Several in vitro models support such a strategy. For example, in single-step selections, co-administration of an inhibitor has been shown to reduce the rate of mutations that cause doxorubicin resistance to a tenth of the rate in the absence of an inhibitor, while suppressing the emergence of PGP-expressing resistant cells145. It must be emphasized, however, that in a trial design that aims to prevent the emergence of drug resistance, significant differences in patient response rates might not be observed. Instead, only differences in the rate of relapse and time to progression would be anticipated. The latter would occur because a prevention strategy does not target most of the cells in a tumour, but only a small subpopulation, and hence does not significantly alter the initial cell kill. Such an outcome has been reported in a study in which cyclosporin A was added to daunorubicin and Ara-C in the initial treatment of patients with AML123.Although this combination regimen had no impact on the complete remission rate, the overall survival and the disease-free survival were improved. Clinical evidence indicates that PGP expression can be induced by drug exposure. In one deacetylase inhibitor FR-901228, an experimental anticancer agent known to be an excellent PGP substrate147. Administration of FR-901228 results in rapid induction of PGP expression in malignant cells from patients with T-cell lymphoma (S.E.B., unpublished observations). These studies indicate that strategies to block upregulation of PGP might also be useful in the clinic. Finally, although it is common for cancer cells to become multidrug resistant, normal human tissues remain sensitive to the toxic effects of chemotherapy. This indicates that multidrug-resistance genes might be used to protect normal tissues against the cytotoxic effects of anticancer drugs. In mice, transfer of genes that encode Mdr1(REF. 148) and methotrexate-resistance proteins149 protects bone marrow from the toxic effects of anticancer drugs such as paclitaxel and methotrexate. Several clinical trials have been undertaken in cancer patients who are undergoing autologous bonemarrow transplants to assay the ability of bone-marrow cells that transgenically express MDR1 to survive after chemotherapy150. However, the finding that mice expressing Mdr1 from a retroviral vector developed myelodysplasia151 indicates that more needs to be known about the effects of drug-resistance genes on normal haematopoietic function before this approach can be undertaken routinely in cancer patients. Nearly three decades after the description of active outward transport of daunorubicin in drugresistant tumour cells152, the study of multidrug resistance is still work in progress.Many questions must be answered about the mechanisms by which cancer cells elude chemotherapy, and known mechanisms of multidrug resistance must undergo further analysis in clinical trials. One conclusion is certain — the mutability and heterogeneity of cancer cells will always provide them with ways to overcome resistance, no matter how new or important the anticancer drug.

7	2006	Targeting multidrug resistance in cancer	Abstract  Effective treatment of metastatic cancers usually requires the use of toxic chemotherapy. In most cases, multiple drugs are used, as resistance to single agents occurs almost universally. For this reason, elucidation of mechanisms that confer simultaneous resistance to different drugs with different targets and chemical structures — multidrug resistance has been a major goal of cancer biologists during the past 35 years. Here, we review the most common of these mechanisms, one that relies on drug efflux from cancer cells mediated by ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. We describe various approaches to combating multidrug-resistant cancer, including the development of drugs that engage, evade or exploit efflux by ABC transporters.  Anticancer drugs can fail to kill cancer cells for various reasons. Drugs are usually given systemically and are therefore subject to variations in absorption, metabolism and delivery to target tissues that can be specific to individual patients. Tumours can be located in parts of the body into which drugs do not easily penetrate, or could be protected by local environments due to increased tissue hydrostatic pressure or altered tumour vasculature. By analogy to the study of antibiotic resistance in microorganisms, research on drug resistance in cancer has focused on cellular resistance due to either the specific nature and genetic background of the cancer cell itself, or the genetic changes that follow toxic chemotherapy. Until recently, the primary method for identifying mechanisms of multidrug resistance (MDR) was to select surviving cancer cells in the presence of cytotoxic drugs and use cellular and molecular biology techniques to identify altered genes that confer drug resistance on naive cells. Such studies indicate that there are three major mechanisms of drug resistance in cells: first, decreased uptake of water-soluble drugs such as folate antagonists, nucleoside analogues and cisplatin, which require transporters to enter cells; second, various changes in cells that affect the capacity of cytotoxic drugs to kill cells, including alterations in cell cycle, increased repair of DNA damage, reduced apoptosis and altered metabolism of drugs; and third, increased energy-dependent efflux of hydrophobic drugs that can easily enter the cells by diffusion through the plasma membrane. Of these mechanisms, the one that is most commonly encountered in the laboratory is the increased efflux of a broad class of hydrophobic cytotoxic drugs that is mediated by one of a family of energy-dependent transporters, known as ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. First described in the 1970s (BOX 1), several members of the ABC transporter family, such as P-glycoprotein (Pgp, also known as ABCB1 or MDR1), can induce MDR. The broad substrate specificity and the abundance of ABC transporter proteins might explain the difficulties faced during the past 20 years in attempting to circumvent ABC-mediated MDR in vivo. Cancer pharmacologists have worked to develop drugs that either evade efflux or inhibit the function of efflux transporters, and although progress in this area has been slow, the rationale for this approach is still strong and suggestions for future directions in this field are included in this review. Recently, bioinformatic approaches, taking advantage of large drug databases tested across well-characterized cell lines, have allowed the identification of several potential cytotoxic substrates recognized by different ABC transporters. In addition, pharmacokinetic analyses and the study of knockout mice have revealed important roles of several ABC transporters in the absorption, excretion and distribution of drugs. ABC transporters are essential for many cellular processes that require the transport of substrates across cell membranes. Therefore, ABC transporters have an important role in drug discovery and development in several areas, including multidrug-resistant cancer and drug targeting to specific compartments. The ABC transporter family ABC transporters, named after their distinctive ATPbinding cassette domains, are conserved proteins that typically translocate solutes across cellular membranes1. The functional unit of an ABC transporter contains two transmembrane domains (TMDs) and two nucleotide Box 1 | Discovery of ABC transporters involved in multidrug resistance In 1973, Dano13 noted the active outward transport of daunomycin in multidrugresistant Ehrlich ascites tumour cells. Subsequent work showed that the ‘reduced drug permeation’ in multidrug-resistant cells is associated with the presence of a cellsurface glycoprotein, termed P-glycoprotein (Pgp)127. Based on the presence of specific conserved sequences, Pgp was recognized to be an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter protein and was proposed to function as an efflux pump128,129–132. A decade later, a human small-cell lung cancer cell line (H69), showing resistance to doxorubicin without increasing expression of Pgp, was identified133. Similar to cells overexpressing Pgp, H69-derivatives showed a combined drug accumulation defect and crossresistance to a broad range of anticancer agents, including anthracyclines, vinca alkaloids and epipodophyllotoxins134,135. Analysis indicated the increased expression of a novel ABC transporter, termed MRP1 (multidrug resistance-associated protein 1)136. This finding also suggested that a more systematic approach could be used to discover additional Pgp-independent mechanisms of drug resistance. Using the Pgp-inhibitor verapamil in conjunction with cytotoxic agent selection resulted in the discovery of a third ABC transporter, named ABCG2 (also known as mitoxantrone resistance protein (MXR) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP))137–139. contain only a ‘half set’ (one TMD and one NBD) form dimers to generate a ‘full’ transporter2. Structures of bacterial ABC transporter proteins suggest that the two NBDs form a common binding site where the energy of ATP is harvested to promote efflux through a pore that is delineated by the transmembrane helices3. The human genome contains 48 genes that encode ABC transporters, which have been divided into seven subfamilies labelled A–G4. Diverse substrates are translocated by ABC transporters, ranging from chemotherapeutic drugs to naturally occurring biological compounds. Although several members of the superfamily have dedicated functions involving the transport of specific substrates, it is becoming increasingly evident that the complex physiological network of ABC transporters has a pivotal role in host detoxification and protection of the body against xenobiotics. This role is revealed by the tissue distribution of ABC transporters, which are highly expressed in important pharmacological barriers, such as the brush border membrane of intestinal cells, the biliary canalicular membrane of hepatocytes, the lumenal membrane in proximal tubules of the kidney and the epithelium that contributes to the blood–brain barrier (BBB) (FIG. 1). Traditionally, the absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and/or toxicity (ADMET) of a drug were thought to be governed by the physicochemical properties of the molecule, protein binding and/or biotransformation5. The capacity of transport proteins to reduce oral bioavailability and alter tissue distribution has obvious implications for pharmaceutical drug design. Indeed, the identification of transporters that influence the disposition and safety of drugs has become a new challenge for drug discovery programmes. It is essential to know, first, whether drugs can freely cross pharmacological barriers or whether their passage is restricted by ABC transporters; and, second, whether drugs can influence the passage of other compounds through the inhibition of ABC transporters. Consequently, the evaluation of transport susceptibility of drug candidates has become an important step in the development of novel therapeutics, and the pharmaceutical industry has adopted routine evaluation of Pgp susceptibility in the drug discovery process (BOX 2). Generation of mice deficient in the mdr1a (abcb1a) and mdr1b (abcb1b) genes, or both, has provided a valuable tool for the assessment of the contribution of Pgp to drug disposition in vivo6. Surprisingly, mdr1a/1b double knockout mice are viable and fertile — almost indistinguishable from their wild-type littermates, suggesting that pharmacological modulation of human Pgp could represent a safe and effective strategy to thwart multi drugresistant cancers. The AUC (area under the plasma concentration versus time curve) of orally administered taxol was found to be significantly higher in the double knockout mice, indicating that Pgp expression at the intestinal lumen can limit oral drug bioavailability7. Further analysis of the knockout animals has demonstrated that the absence of Pgp has a profound effect on the tissue distribution of substrate compounds. So, if a drug is subject to Pgp-mediated efflux, its pharmacokinetic profile will be substantially altered by the use of Pgp inhibitors. Consistent with its high expression in brain capillary cells, Pgp also presents a barrier to hydrophobic compounds that would otherwise penetrate the BBB by passive diffusion. Pgp can thereby reduce the efficacy of agents targeted to the central nervous system (CNS) to treat epilepsy, central infections (such as HIV) or brain tumours8. Penetration of CNStargeted compounds through the BBB can be estimated by comparing the brain-to-plasma ratios of drugs in Pgpdeficient mice to those of normal mice (FIG. 2). However, in vivo studies are not compatible with high-throughput screening (HTS) of drugs, and the knockout mouse system can provide misleading information, because there are significant species differences between the substrate specificities of human and mouse Pgp9. ABC transporters and in vitro MDR Fulfilling their role in detoxification, several ABC transporters have been found to be overexpressed in cancer cell lines cultured under selective pressure (BOX 1). So far, tissue culture studies have consistently shown that the major mechanism of MDR in most cultured cancer cells involves Pgp, multidrug resistance associated-protein 1 (MRP1, also known as ABCC1) or ABCG2. However, cells selected to be resistant to various cytotoxic agents were found to overexpress additional ABC transporters, and several more were found to confer drug resistance in transfection studies. Current understanding indicates that at least 12 ABC transporters from four ABC subfamilies have a role in the drug resistance of cells maintained in tissue culture (FIG. 3). ABCB subfamily. Pgp, a member of the ABCB subfamily, stands out among ABC transporters by conferring the strongest resistance to the widest variety of compounds. Pgp transports drugs that are central to most chemotherapeutic regimens, including (but certainly not limited to) vinca alkaloids, anthracyclines, epipodophyllotoxins and Assessment of susceptibility to transport by P-glycoprotein It has been a challenge to find reliable cell-based or biochemical tools that enable rapid analysis of susceptibility of drug candidates to transport by P-glycoprotein (Pgp) in the pharmaceutical setting. Pgp-mediated transport is coupled to ATP hydrolysis, which is often stimulated by transported substrates10,140. To determine whether a candidate drug is a substrate or inhibitor of Pgp, measurement of ATPase activity can be carried out in a high-throughput manner using isolated membrane vesicles from cells expressing high concentrations of Pgp141. However, there are substrates and inhibitors that have little effect on the Pgp-mediated ATPase activity. Consequently, the susceptibility of compounds to Pgp-mediated transport is usually evaluated directly in intact cell systems, using cells that overexpress Pgp. In vivo, drugs have to cross pharmacological barriers to be absorbed, distributed or excreted. This transcellular movement is best modelled by monolayer efflux assays. In these assays, polarized epithelial or endothelial cells expressing various ATP-binding cassette transporters are grown on semipermeable filters. Pgp, localized on the apical surface of the cells, reduces transport in the apical-to-basolateral direction (that is, absorption from the gastrointestinal lumen to the blood) and increases transport of drug substrates in the basolateral to apical direction (FIG. 2). This system provides evaluation of direct transport and is widely used for the assessment of Pgp susceptibility. ABCC subfamily. Whereas Pgp transports unmodified neutral or positively charged hydrophobic compounds, the ABCC subfamily members (the MRPs) also transport organic anions and Phase II metabolic products. Indeed, this synergism between the efflux systems and the metabolizing/conjugating enzymes provides a formidable alliance for drug elimination. In addition to the MDR-like core structure consisting of two NBDs and two TMDs, MRPs are composed of additional domains. ABCC1, ABCC2, ABCC3, ABCC6 and ABCC10 contain an amino (N)-terminal membrane-bound region connected to the core by a cytoplasmic linker. The four remaining members (ABCC4, ABCC5, ABCC11 and ABCC12) lack the N-terminal TMD (but not the linker region, which is characteristic of the subfamily23). ABCC1 (widely known as MRP1) is expressed in a wide range of tissues, clinical tumours24 and cancer cell lines25. MRP1 confers resistance to several hydrophobic compounds that are also Pgp substrates (FIG. 3). In addition, like other members of the ABCC subfamily, MRP1 can export glutathione (GSH), glucuronate or sulphate conjugates of organic anions. MRP1 homologues implicated in resistance to anticancer agents include ABCC2 (MRP2), ABCC3 (MRP3), ABCC6 (MRP6) and ABCC10 (MRP7). In contrast to most ABCC subfamily members, which are typically expressed in basolateral membranes, MRP2 is localized in the apical membranes of polarized cells, such as hepatocytes and enterocytes. So, MRP2 has a pivotal role in the export of organic anions, unconjugated bile acids and xenobiotics into the bile, and also contributes to protection against orally ingested drugs26. The phenotype associated with mutations in the gene encoding MRP2 is called Dubin–Johnson syndrome, a condition in which the lack of hepatobiliary transport of non-bile salt organic anions results in conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia27. MRP2 transports many of the same drugs as MRP1, with some notable differences (FIG. 3). Cells selected in cisplatin, arsenite or 9-nitro-camptothecin show increased MRP2 expression28–31. Although MRP2 has been detected in clinical specimens of cancers of renal, gastric, colorectal and hepatocellular origin, its expression has not been found to be predictive of response to chemotherapy. Despite the similarity of their sequences, MRP3 transports fewer compounds than MRP1 or MRP2. Interestingly, MRP3 has a preference for glucuronides over GSH conjugates. Substrates of MRP3 include anticancer drugs and some bile acid species, as well as several glucuronate, sulphate and GSH conjugates32. MRP3 is mainly expressed in the kidney, liver and gut33, which suggests a role for this protein in the enterohepatic circulation of bile salts. However, recent analysis of mrp3-deficient mice has not revealed any abnormalities in bile acid homeostasis, indicating that Mrp3 does not have a key role in bile salt physiology34,35. MRP3 expression has been observed in cancer tissues36,37, and a correlation with doxorubicin resistance in lung cancer has been reported38. However, as MRP3 does not transport anthracyclines (FIG. 3), this correlation is not likely to be based on a causal relationship. Intriguingly, mutations of the MRP6 gene cause pseudoxanthoma elasticum, a systemic connective tissue disorder that affects elastin fibres of the skin, retina and blood vessels39. Studies indicate that MRP6-transfected cells become resistant to natural product agents, including etoposide, teniposide, doxorubicin and daunorubicin, whereas MRP7 is a resistance factor for taxanes40,41. As overexpression of MRP3, MRP6 or MRP7 has not been detected in resistant cell lines, their involvement in clinically relevant drug resistance or the physiological defence of tissues against xenobiotic compounds seems limited42,43. The ABCC subfamily contains four additional members that lack the N-terminal TMD. ABCC4 (MRP4), and ABCC5 (MRP5) confer resistance to nucleoside analogues such as 6-mercaptopurine and 6-thioguanine. Overexpression and amplification of the MRP4 gene correlates with increased resistance to PMEA (9- (2-phosphonylmethoxyethyl)adenine) and efflux of azidothymidine monophosphate from cells and, therefore, with resistance to this drug44. The function of ABCC11 (MRP8) and ABCC12 (MRP9) is relatively unexplored. Cells overexpressing MRP8 are resistant to commonly used purine and pyrimidine nucleotide analogues45 and to NSC 671136, a candidate anticancer drug tested against the NCI60 cancer cell panel25. In addition, MRP8 is thought to participate in physiological processes involving bile acids and conjugated steroids46 Taken together, data from the literature indicate that several members of the ABCC (MRP) subfamily that have unrelated primary functions can be subverted for drug transport. However, it is still unclear whether experiments involving cells engineered to overexpress ABC transporters can be interpreted to suggest a general role for MRPs in clinical anticancer drug resistance. ABCG subfamily. In contrast to most MRPs (with the possible exception of MRP1), ABCG2 (MXR/BCRP) clearly has the potential to contribute to the drug resistance of cancer cells. ABCG2, which is overexpressed in several cell lines selected for anticancer drug resistance, is a high-capacity transporter with wide substrate specificity. Transported substrates include cytotoxic drugs, toxins and carcinogens found in food products, as well as endogenous compounds47,48. Although several ABC transporters can transport methotrexate, ABCG2 has been shown to extrude glutamated folates, suggesting that it can provide resistance to both short- and long-term methotrexate exposure49. In addition, ABCG2 can transport some of the most recently developed anticancer drugs, such as 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN-38)50 or tyrosine kinase inhibitors51. In all probability, the list shown in FIG. 3 will grow as new substrates or inhibitors are identified and additional ABC transporter proteins associated with decreased drug sensitivity of cancer cells are discovered. Screens carried out with the NCI60 cell panel indicate that there is a strong correlation between expression of several ABC transporters and decreased chemosensitivity, and also suggest that as many as 31 of the 48 ABC transporters could blunt the potency of the antitumour drugs screened in the study25. In addition, many other transporters, not related to the ABC family, potentially have a role in drug sensitivity and disposition. Experiments are underway to determine which of these can indeed confer drug resistance to tumours. Significance of ABC transporters in cancer Much has been learned about ABC transporters since MDR was first described52. Despite the wealth of information collected about the biochemistry and substrate specificity of ABC transporters, translation of this knowledge from the bench to the bedside has proved to be unexpectedly difficult. Of the transporters shown in FIG. 3, only inhibitors of Pgp, and to a lesser extent MRP1 and ABCG2, have been evaluated in clinical trials. In vitro, these three transporters efflux a broad range of chemotherapeutics used clinically for first- and second-line treatment of cancer. In that setting, inhibitors can often dramatically sensitize drug-resistant cell lines to known substrates. It is to be expected that this same effect would also occur in vivo. So, are ABC transporters important clinically, and does their inhibition translate into improved patient survival? Answers to the first part of this question come mainly from correlative studies evaluating the effect of Pgp expression on patient survival, whereas answers to the latter emanate from trials that combine chemotherapy with targeted inhibitors of Pgp-mediated drug transport. Impact of ABC transporters on tumour response and patient survival. The role of ABC transporters in clinical anticancer resistance has been difficult to assess53. As is the case for most potentially useful cancer biomarkers, no universally accepted guidelines for analytical or clinical validation exist. Differences in tissue collection methodologies (for example, whole tissue versus laser-capture microdissection), molecular targets (for example, mRNA versus protein) and protocols have limited the ability to compare results across institutions. In addition, the absence of standardized criteria to score expression and effect has hampered adequate clinical validation. Deciphering the impact of ABC transporter expression on patient survival is also challenging because of the Figure 3 | Substrates and inhibitors of ATP-binding cassette transporters. a | Overlapping substrate specificities of the human ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters confering drug resistance to cancer cells. A single drug can be exported by several ABC transporters (rows), and each ABC transporter can confer characteristic resistance patterns to cells (columns). To determine which ABC transporters are involved in multidrug resistance (MDR), two different experimental procedures are common. Cells could be selected in increasing concentrations of a cytotoxic drug, which could result in the increased expression of a specific ABC transporter (see green boxes representing drug–gene pairs in which an ABC transporter was found to be overexpressed in cell lines selected for resistance to the respective drug). Resistant cells overexpressing a single ABC transporter often show characteristic cross-resistance to other, structurally unrelated, drugs (red boxes). Some ABC transporters were found to confer drug resistance only in transfection studies, in which cells are engineered to overexpress a given transporter. On transfection, cells become resistant to compounds that are substrates for transport (red boxes). White boxes denote unexplored or absent drug–gene relationships. b | The ability of ABC transporters to alter cell survival, drug transport and/or drug accumulation can be inhibited or altered by various modulators (yellow boxes). As in a, white boxes denote unexplored or absent drug–gene relationships. *The transport of these drugs by ABCG2 is dependent on an amino acid variation at position 482 (wild type is R; variants include R482G and R482T).

AZT, azidothymidine; 5-FU, fluorouracil; PMEA, 9-(2-phosphonylmethoxyethyl)adenine. mediated MDR, the first Phase I and II clinical trials began to test the clinical potential of Pgp inhibitors. Initial trials used ‘first-generation’ Pgp inhibitors, including verapamil, quinine and cyclosporine (also known as cyclosporin A), which were already approved for other medical purposes. In general, these compounds were ineffective or toxic at the doses required to attenuate Pgp function. Despite these problems, a randomized Phase III clinical trial showed the benefit of addition of cyclosporine to treatment with cytarabine and daunorubicin in patients with poor-risk AML68. Similarly, quinine was shown to increase the complete remission rate as well as survival in Pgp-positive MDS cases treated with intensive chemotherapy69, suggesting that successful Pgp modulation is feasible. However, several other trials failed to show improvement of the outcome and toxic side effects were common70 (TABLE 1). Promising early clinical trials encouraged further development. The second generation of inhibitors were devoid of side effects related to the primary toxicity of the compounds. For example, the R-enantiomer of verapamil and the cyclosporin D analogue PSC-833 (Valspodar) antagonized Pgp function without blocking calcium channels or immunosuppressive effects, respectively71. PSC-833 has been tested most frequently in clinical trials (TABLE 1), albeit with little success. Characteristic of the failures of second-generation inhibitors, PSC-833 induced pharmacokinetic interactions that limited drug clearance and metabolism of chemotherapy, thereby elevating plasma concentrations beyond acceptable toxicity. To preserve patient safety, empirical chemotherapy dose reductions were necessary; however, because pharmacokinetic interactions were generally unpredictable, some patients were probably under-dosed whereas others were over-dosed. Related to these problems, a Phase III trial using PSC- 833 in previously untreated patients with AML who were >60 years old was closed early due to excessive mortality during induction in the experimental arm72 (TABLE 1). A subsequent dose-escalation trial involving 410 patients with AML who were <60 years old revealed an overall survival advantage in an unplanned subset of patients of <45 years old73. That apparent benefit has not been duplicated, and it is unlikely to be, as development of PSC-833 has been discontinued. Similarly, development of another second-generation inhibitor showing initial promise (VX-710; biricodar) has been curtailed74. Third-generation inhibitors are designed specifically for high transporter affinity and low pharmacokinetic interaction. Inhibition of cytochrome P450 3A, which is responsible for many adverse pharmacokinetic effects with previous-generation inhibitors (BOX 3), has generally been avoided with the latest generation of inhibitors, including laniquidar (R101933), oc144-093 (ONT-093), zosuquidar (LY335979), elacridar (GF-120918)75 and tariquidar (XR9576)76. Tariquidar has the added benefit of extended Pgp inhibition, as a single intravenous dose inhibited efflux of rhodamine from CD56+ cells (biomarker lymphoid cells that express Pgp) for at least 48 hours77. Several later-generation inhibitors act on multiple ABC transporters (FIG. 3). Biricodar (VX-710) and GF-120918, for example, bind Pgp as well as MRP1 and ABCG2, respectively78. Although affinity for multiple drug transporters might extend the functionality of these inhibitors to Pgp-negative tumours showing MDR, the scope of possible side effects also increases. In 2002, Phase III clinical trials began using tariquidar as an adjunctive treatment in combination with first-line chemotherapy for patients with NSCLC. Despite the promising characteristics mentioned above, the studies were stopped early because of toxicities associated with the cytotoxic drugs (a full explanation for trial closure is not available)79. This study also illustrates a defect in experimental design, as there is no strong evidence to suggest that NSCLC expresses Pgp to a significant extent (BOX 4). Following the review of the aborted trials, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) has commenced further exploratory Phase I/II and Phase III studies with tariquidar. Zosuquidar has recently been evaluated in patients with AML. Preliminary analysis indicates that zosuquidar can be safely given without chemotherapy dose reductions (L. D. Cripe, personal communication); trial endpoints have not yet been analysed. Although Pgp is clearly established as a prognostic marker in adult AML, after more than three decades of research, the clinical benefit of modulating Pgp-mediated MDR is still in question. This is, in part, due to limitations of candidate inhibitors, and the inadequate design of the trials80 (BOXES 3,4). Although most trials using first- and second-generation inhibitors give reason to doubt the benefit of Pgp modulation, the verdict is still out. Clearly, the inhibitors used today are much improved from those used in the past, with greater substrate specificity, lower toxicity and improved pharmacokinetic profiles. Results from Phase III trials using third-generation inhibitors will be pivotal in determining whether inhibition of Pgp, or other ABC transporters, can result in improved patient survival. Clinical trials have distilled the concept of an ideal transporter antagonist. The perfect reversing agent is efficient, lacks unrelated pharmacological effects, shows no pharmacokinetic interactions with other drugs, tackles specific mechanisms of resistance with high potency and is readily administered to patients. This might be too much to ask from a cancer drug that targets a network of transporters with a pivotal role in ADMET. In more realistic terms, the ideal inhibitor should restore treatment efficiency to that observed in MDR-negative cases. Nevertheless, modulators are unlikely to improve the therapeutic index of anticancer drugs unless agents that lack significant pharmacokinetic interactions are found81. The search for such ‘fourth generation’ inhibitors is ongoing, and there is no shortage of compounds showing in vitro sensitization of MDR cells. Similar to their predecessors, some of the emerging candidates are ‘off the shelf ’ compounds (old drugs with new tricks), such as disulfiram, used to treat alcoholism82, or herbal constituents83 shown to inhibit Pgp function in vitro in concentrations that are compatible with clinical applicability. Recent developments in pharmacology, such as the introduction of HTS technology and ‘screen-friendly’ synthetic chemical libraries, combined with improved understanding of substrate–protein interactions84 should enable rational planning and de novo synthesis of novel Pgp modulators85. In addition to traditional pharmacological modulation, more creative approaches have emerged in the literature. These strategies to engage, evade or even exploit efflux-based resistance mechanisms are discussed in the next section (FIG. 4). Alternative approaches to targeting MDR Peptides and antibodies that inhibit Pgp. Pgp-mediated drug resistance can be reversed by hydrophobic peptides that are high-affinity Pgp substrates. Such peptides, showing high specificity to Pgp, could represent a new class of compounds for consideration as potential chemosensitizers86. Small peptides corresponding to the transmembrane segments of Pgp act through a different mechanism. Peptide analogues of TMDs are believed to interfere with the proper assembly or function of the target protein, as was shown in experiments aimed at the in vitro87 or in vivo88 inhibition of G-protein-coupled receptors. Small peptides designed to correspond to the transmembrane segments of Pgp act as specific and potent inhibitors, suggesting that TMDs of ABC transporters can also serve as templates for inhibitor design89. Studies suggest that immunization could be an alternative supplement to chemotherapy. A mouse monoclonal antibody directed against extracellular epitopes of Pgp was shown to inhibit the in vitro efflux of drug substrates90. Similarly, immunization of mice with external sequences of the murine gene mdr1 elicited antibodies capable of reverting the MDR phenotype in vitro and in vivo, without eliciting an autoimmune response91. Targeted downregulation of MDR genes. Selective downregulation of resistance genes in cancer cells is an emerging approach in therapeutics. Although in cell lines MDR is often a result of the amplification of the MDR1 gene, the overexpression of the protein has transcriptional components as well. Regulation of Pgp expression is amazingly complex, and could include different mechanisms in normal tissues compared with cancer cells92. If mechanisms governing expression of Pgp in malignant cells were mediated through tumour-specific pathways, cancer-specific approaches to circumvent Pgp overexpression could be developed with minimal effect on constitutive expression of normal cells93. Using peptide combinatorial libraries, Bartsevich et al.94 designed transcriptional repressors that selectively bind to the MDR1 promoter. Expression of the repressor peptides in highly drug-resistant cancer cells resulted in a selective reduction of Pgp levels and a marked increase in chemosensitivity94,95. Similarly, antagonists of the nuclear steroid and xenobiotic receptor (SXR), which coordinately regulate drug metabolism and efflux, can be used in conjunction with anticancer drugs to prevent the induction of Pgp96. Using technologies that enable the targeted regulation of genes — antisense oligonucleotides, hammerhead ribozymes and short-interfering RNA Potential reasons for the failure of compounds that target P-glycoprotein (Pgp) in Phase III trials include142: Alternative mechanisms of resistance Unfavourable pharmacological properties of the inhibitors: • Low affinity (ineffective inhibition) • Poor specificity (unrelated pharmacological activity) • Low bioavailability at tumour site Toxicity of the inhibitors: • Primary toxicity of the first- and second-generation reversing agents (for example, hypotension, ataxia and immunosuppression) • Secondary toxicity due to inhibition of Pgp in physiological sanctuaries such as bone marrow stem cells Pharmacokinetic interactions143: • Pgp modulators can decrease the systemic clearance of anticancer drugs, thereby increasing exposure to normal and malignant cells and so potentially increasing the severity and/or incidence of adverse effects associated with the anticancer therapy144. • There is a considerable overlap in the substrate specificities and regulation of cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) and Pgp. CYP3A, the major Phase I drug-metabolizing enzyme, and Pgp have complementary roles in intestinal drug metabolism, where, through repeated extrusion and reabsorption, Pgp ensures elongated exposure of the drugs to the metabolizing enzyme145. Inhibition of Pgp can interfere with CYP3Amediated intestinal or liver metabolism, resulting in reduced drug clearance. • Interaction with other ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, such as ABCB4 and ABCB11, which results in compromised biliary flow146. Empirical dose-modification of chemotherapy: • To accommodate expected elevations in systemic drug exposure, some patients might Novel anticancer agents designed to evade efflux15. Several novel anticancer drugs are exported by ABC transporters, including irinotecan (and its metabolite SN-38), depsipeptide, imatinib (Gleevec; Novartis) and flavopiridol (FIG. 3). Moreover, the NCI60 screen suggests that a significant portion of the compounds in the drug development pipeline are substrates of ABC transporters25,53. Epothilones are novel microtubule-targeting agents with a paclitaxellike mechanism of action that are not recognized by Pgp, providing proof of the concept that new classes of anticancer agents that do not interact with the multidrug transporters can be developed to improve response to therapy. As most anticancer agents subject to efflux are currently irreplaceable in chemotherapy regimens, an attractive solution would be to chemically modify their susceptibility to being transported while retaining antineoplastic activity. Although such modifications frequently decrease the bioavailability or efficacy of drugs, some new agents have been developed using this approach99. The intracellular concentration of drugs can also be elevated by increasing the rate of influx. This ‘apparent circumvention’ of Pgp-mediated efflux can be achieved by increasing the lipophilicity of compounds (positive charge and degree of lipophilicity dictate, or at least influence, whether compounds are recognized by MDR1) or by stealth formulations. For example, highly lipophilic anthracycline analogues100, such as annamycin and idarubicin, were shown to elicit a high remission rate in Pgp-positive AML cases with primary resistance to chemotherapy101. The efficacy of these drugs is currently being evaluated in the MRC AML15 trial59. Encapsulation of doxorubicin in polyethylene glycol-coated liposomes (PLD) might be safer and occasionally more effective than conventional doxorubicin102. PLD was found to cross the BBB, and seemed to overcome the MDR of tumours in preclinical models. The combination of this formulation with PSC- 833 suppressed tumour growth to an even greater degree in mouse xenograft models, providing proof-of-principle for Phase I studies103,104. A clever approach combines drugs encapsulated in polymeric micelles with ultrasound treatment of tumours. As a consequence of the encapsulation, the systemic concentration and cellular uptake of the drug decreases, reducing unwanted side effects. To trigger drug release, the tumour is irradiated with ultrasound105. Theoretically, the simplest way to counter efflux mechanisms is to increase drug exposure of cancer cells through prolonged or higher-dose chemotherapy. Indeed, it could well be that the benefit of classical inhibitors was derived solely from the augmented dose intensity of the concomitantly administered chemotherapeutics, as opposed to the pharmacodynamic modulation of target cells106. Unfortunately, the therapeutic window of anticancer agents is very narrow, as even a slight increase in chemotherapy dosages results in potentially lethal side effects. Exploiting drug resistance by protection of normal cells. A major dose-limiting factor of standard chemotherapy is bone-marrow toxicity. When transferred to haematopoietic cells, Pgp was shown to protect the bone marrow, suggesting the feasibility of chemotherapeutic regimens at formerly unacceptable doses107. This approach can also be used in stem-cell-based gene therapy, as the co-expression of a drug-resistance protein with a therapeutic gene product in genetically modified stem cells allows both the in vitro enrichment of the corrected cells and in vivo drug selection during clinical gene therapy. Another strategy to selectively protect normal cells is based on drug combinations that include a cytotoxic and a cytoprotective agent108. In the presence of the protective agent, normal cells remain unharmed, whereas MDR cells, which pump out the protective agent, succumb to the cytotoxic therapy (‘unshielding of MDR cells’). For example, the non-Pgpsubstrate apoptosis-inducing agent flavopiridol was shown to selectively kill Pgp-expressing cells when used in combination with the caspase-inhibitor Z-DEVD-fmk, which is pumped out from MDR cells109. Exploiting drug resistance by targeting MDR cells with peptides and antibodies. Ideally, therapy is directed against specific target cells. MDR cancer cells are eminent targets for destruction, and the high surface expression of Pgp could be exploited in strategies that use antibodies to tailored treatment that targets growth-promoting pathways and circumvents drug resistance. In considering how to go about cataloguing important mechanisms of drug resistance in cancer, it makes sense to begin by focusing on the family of ABC transporters, as they are widely expressed in cancer cells and their capacity to confer drug resistance has been established, at least in vitro. Pgp represents one of the best-studied mechanisms of resistance to hydrophobic anticancer drugs. It remains to be seen whether other ABC transporters will emerge as culprits for treatment failure. pharmaceutical companies have begun to lose interest. Only a few compounds are currently in clinical trials, as the development of most of the inhibitors (including valspodar (PSC-833), dexniguldipine, dextroverapamil and biricodar (VX-710)) has been discontinued. The bottleneck seems to be the unwelcome inhibition of ABC transporters at pharmacologically important locations. However, as more and more information about pharmacokinetic effects accumulate, new-generation inhibitors become more specific and potent (as shown through careful Pgp measurements and surrogate biological markers of Pgp inhibition). Ultimately, we anticipate that the efficacy of ABC transporter modulation will be established in a subset of human cancers. A clear-cut demonstration of the effectiveness of targeting Pgp will result in renewed interest and the development of further ABC transporter inhibitors will follow suit. In the meantime, several new therapeutic modalities can be explored using existing inhibitors. Most of the clinical trials have been carried out in patients with prior therapies, in whom acquired resistance is likely to have developed through multiple mechanisms. It could well be that ABC transporters have a role in the initial phases of tumour evolution, to provide a window of opportunity for the cancer cells to develop alternative mechanisms of resistance. To test this hypothesis, clinical trials could be carried out to assess the possibility of preventing, rather than fighting, MDR cancer106. ABC transporter modulators could also be used to influence the oral bioavailability or increased CNS penetration of drugs125. Studies should also address the significant heterogeneity associated with individual responses to pharmacological treatment, in particular the role of inherited traits in limiting drug disposition. It is reasonable to assume that genetic variations in ABC transporters have profound effects on pharmacokinetics. The clinical relevance of Pgp polymorphisms has been intensively studied, and a synonymous mutation (C3435T) has been shown by some laboratories to be associated with altered protein expression and consequent changes in drug disposition126. C3435T is part of a haplotype that might contribute to this altered drug-transport phenotype, but most studies are not sufficiently statistically powered to give convincing results. Despite the controversy, some consider Pgp to be a prominent example of the effectiveness of pharmacogenomics in associating polymorphisms with clinically relevant variables. The enormous effort of cancer biologists and pharmacologists to understand MDR in cancer has resulted in the identification of a limited number of distinct, clinically proven mechanisms. Overexpression of ABC transporters, particularly Pgp, has consistently been implicated as a cause for MDR both in vitro and in vivo. Recent strategies to engage, evade or exploit this transporter to improve cancer treatment reflect both the creativity and hopefulness of cancer researchers	Gergely Szakács*, Jill K.

8	2000	Multidrug resistance (MDR) in cancer Mechanisms, reversal using modulators of MDR and the role of MDR modulators in influencing the pharmacokinetics of anticancer drugs	In recent years, there has been an increased understanding of P-glycoprotein (P-GP)-mediated pharmacokinetic interactions. In addition, its role in modifying the bioavailability of orally administered drugs via induction or inhibition has been also been demonstrated in various studies. This overview presents a background on some of the commonly documented mechanisms of multidrug resistance (MDR), reversal using modulators of MDR, followed by a discussion on the functional aspects of P-GP in the context of the pharmacokinetic interactions when multiple agents are coadministered. While adverse pharmacokinetic interactions have been documented with first and second generation MDR modulators, certain newer agents of the third generation class of compounds have been less susceptible in eliciting pharmacokinetic interactions.

The second method, termed the efflux bioassay, could detect P-gp and other non-P-gp efflux depending on bioassay culture conditions. Results: Sixty-two percent of the specimens were considered positive for blasts with P-gp function, and 26% of such P-gp-positive specimens also exhibited zosuquidar-resistant (i.e., non-P-gp) MDR efflux activity; 37% of P-gp-negative AML blast specimens displayed zosuquidar-resistant MDR function in the efflux bioassay. Conclusions: These results confirm the heterogeneous nature of MDR efflux pumps in AML blasts, and provide support for the hypothesis that non-P-gp MDR contributed to negative results with zosuquidar in AML trials. Multidrug resistance (MDR) efflux pumps capable of eliminating chemotherapeutic drugs from tumor cells contribute to clinical drug resistance in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and other cancers (1–6). Expression of MDR in AML blasts is well known for redundancy with multiple molecular species capable of actively eliminating drugs from the neoplastic cells (4–6). Heterogeneity of MDR mechanisms has been hypothesized as a significant factor in the failed clinical studies for zosuquidar, a P-glycoprotein (P-gp)-specific MDR modulator (1,2). Much of MDR activity is mediated by transmembrane proteins belonging to the superfamily of ATP-binding developed to displayed greater specificity for P-gp, less reactivity versus other efflux pumps, and to minimally alter PK of concomitant chemotherapy (1,2). Zosuquidar, a third generation P-gp modulator, fits the desired characteristics of P-gp specificity and minimal PK alterations of concomitant chemotherapy (18–27). However, results from a pivotal zosuquidar clinical trial (E3999) in elderly AML conducted by the ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group were negative (27). Elderly patients with AML were treated in study E3999 with daunorubicin (P-gp substrate) and cytarabine, with and without zosuquidar. P-gp was identified as an independent adverse prognostic factor for overall survival, but zosuquidar failed to provide improve survival vs. placebo in patients with P-gp-positive blasts. Non-P-gp drug resistance mechanisms were speculated as significant contributors for the lack of efficacy of zosuquidar in E3999 (1,2,27,28). An important patient stratification variable in clinical trials of P-gp modulation has been the identification and relative quantification of blast expression and function of P-gp and other MDR mediators. Flow cytometry is an efficient technique for measuring MDR functional activities (21,26–34), whereby leukemic blasts can be shown to efflux or eliminate fluorescent substrate drugs (e.g., daunorubicin) or dye surrogates like rhodamine- 123 (Rh123) and 3,30-diethyloxacarbocyanine iodide (DiOC2). There are two basic functional bioassay formats using these methods, the efflux and the accumulation bioassays. The efflux bioassay involves loading of cells with a fluorescent MDR substrate drug or dye, and incubation of the cells at 37C to allow for dye efflux (28,29,31). Controls include incubation of cells at 4C to define total dye loading, and incubation at 37C with and without an efflux inhibitor (e.g., zosuquidar, CsA). The efflux bioassay can detect multiple MDR pump activities depending on the incubation conditions and specificities of the modulator and substrate drug or dye. The efflux bioassay was used in this study to measure P-gp and non-P-gp efflux activities in AML blasts. The accumulation bioassay involves culturing cells at 37C with fluorescent dye alone or with dye plus a MDR modulator like P-gp-specific zosuquidar (21,26,30). In this case, P-gp-positive cells accumulate little of the substrate dye when cultured without zosuquidar because of continual P-gp efflux activity. P-gppositive cells as cultured with dye plus P-gp modulator accumulate substantially more dye because efflux activity would be inhibited. Cells lacking P-gp accumulate the same level of dye regardless if P-gp modulator is present or not. The accumulation bioassay is therefore specific to the modulator, since only cells expressing the specific efflux pump will demonstrate a positive response with enhanced dye or drug accumulation. The accumulation assay was used in the presence study to unequivocally differentiate P-gp-positive from P-gpnegative leukemic blast efflux activities. Described herein is an analysis of leukemic blast MDR function with bone marrow aspirates from 50 patients with newly diagnosed AML. Comparative CD34+ blast responses were examined using the accumulation and efflux bioassays with zosuquidar to differentiate P-gp from non-P-gp efflux activities. This cellular analysis clearly identifies MDR heterogeneity in the leukemic cell populations, including blasts that are (1) MDR-negative by DiOC2 efflux or accumulation bioassays, (2) only P-gp-positive given the constraints of the bioassays, and (3) obviously positive for at least one other MDR efflux pump in blasts expressing or lacking appreciable P-gp. METHODS AML Patient Specimens Bone marrow aspirates were collected from 50 elderly AML patients prior to enrollment in zosuquidar Phase I/II and II clinical trials (26,27). The patient samples were from two independent cohorts in studies of newly diagnosed primary and secondary AML: Study E3999 and a separate Phase I/II trial sponsored by Kanisa Pharmaceuticals (KAN-979). All patients were enrolled with written informed consent and IRB approval in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Eligible patients for cohort 1 (Phase I/II) have been previously described (26) and were 55–75 years of age. Eligible patients for cohort 2 (Phase II) have been previously described as well (27) and were > 60 years of age. All other eligibility criteria were similar between cohorts, such as ECOG performance status, acceptable levels of serum metabolites (e.g., bilirubin, creatinine), and a resting left ventricular cardiac ejection fraction of >45%. Miscellaneous Reagents DiOC2 was purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). Fluorochrome-labeled anti-CD antibodies were purchased from BD Biosciences (La Jolla, CA), including anti-CD45-PerCP and -APC-Cy7, anti-CD3-APC and -PerCE-Cy5.5, anti-CD34-APC, anti-CD11b-PE and -PECy7, and anti-CD56-PE. Phosphate-buffered saline, and RPMI 1640 supplemented with HEPES were purchased from BioWhittaker Molecular Applications (Rockland, ME). Zosuquidar was prepared by Formatech (Andover, MA) under contract with Kanisa Pharmaceuticals (San Diego, CA). Functional Bioassays with AML Patient Specimens White cells were enriched from bone marrow aspirates by elimination of red blood cells (RBC) using either ammonium chloride RBC lysis (cohort 1) or Ficoll-Paque step-gradient purification (cohort 2) (26,27,30). Development experiments established that comparable P-gp responses are observed with peripheral blood natural killer (NK) cells enriched by RBC lysis or gradient purification, as discussed (30). The white cells from cohort 1 specimens were used fresh, while those from cohort 2 had been cryopreserved. The cells were washed with serum-free RPMI-1640 and resuspended to 107 cells/mL in RPMI-1640. An aliquot of the cells was treated with saturating concentrations of PerCP-labeled anti-CD45 and APC-conjugated anti- CD34 (20–30 min, room temperature, in the dark). The cells were subsequently washed, resuspended to 107 cells/mL in RPMI-1640, and aliquoted into two 15-mL conical centrifuge tubes for further processing for the accumulation (0.10 mL/tube, 1.0 × 106 cells) and efflux bioassays (0.15 mL/tube, 1.5 × 106 cells). Development work established that saturation of P-gp modulation with zosuquidar occurs at ~1–10 ng/mL in serum-free cultures of P-gp-positive normal NK cells and K562/R7 leukemia cell line (26,30), as documented by others (21). Both the accumulation and efflux bioassays used 100 ng/mL final zosuquidar concentration for P-gpspecific modulation as described below. The Efflux Bioassay The cells for the efflux assay were further diluted to 0.4 mL with RPMI-1640 before addition of 0.1 mL RPMI- 1640 containing 500 ng/mL DiOC2 (100 ng/mL final DiOC2, and 3 × 106 cells/mL). The cells were incubated 45 min at 37C to allow dye accumulation. The cells were subsequently washed with ice-cold RPMI-1640 and resuspended with the same medium, before being distributed into six chilled 12 × 75 mm polystyrene tubes, 300 μL/ tube (~2.5 × 105 cells/tube). These tubes of cells were organized into three groups of duplicate tubes. The first two groups were inoculated with 200 μL/tube of RPMI- 1640 and incubated 90  10 min at (a) 4C for baseline dye loading determinations (active transport inhibited), and (b) 37C for maximal efflux activity. The third efflux group was inoculated with 200 μL/tube RPMI-1640 containing 250 ng/mL zosuquidar, yielding a saturating 100 ng/mL final zosuquidar concentration. These latter tubes were also incubated at 37C for 90 min to determine the effects of selective P-gp modulation on dye efflux. Following incubation, the processed cells were stored on ice until flow cytometry analysis as previously described (27,28,31). A target of 25 K events was collected for each of the duplicate tubes/group. The Accumulation Bioassay An aliquot of anti-CD-stained cells (100 μL of 107 / mL) was diluted to 1.2 mL with RPMI-1640, of which 300 μL was distributed into each of four chilled tubes (2.5 × 105/tube). All tubes were inoculated with 100 μL ice-cold medium containing 10 ng/mL DiOC2. The tubes were distributed into two groups; the first group of duplicate tubes was inoculated with 100 μL medium alone and the second group with 100 μL medium containing 500 ng/mL zosuquidar (100 ng/mL final concentration). The bioassay cultures were incubated at 37C (water bath) for 60  5 min, before washing and resuspending with ice-cold RPMI-1640. The washed cells were stored on ice until flow cytometry analysis (21,26,30). A target of 25 K events was collected for each of duplicate tubes/group. Data Analysis Descriptive statistics, 2-tailed Fisher exact test, and Spearman rank correlation analyses were conducted using Statistica software (StatSoft, Inc., Tulsa, OK). Ratios and percentage determinations were calculated as illustrated by the equations shown in Table 1. Five key calculations using mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) values allowed for cross comparisons between blast populations in the two bioassays. The calculations include (1) P-gp accumulation ratio, (2) P-gp efflux ratio, (3) percent unimpeded efflux for total MDR activity, (4) percent efflux in the presence of zosuquidar, and (5) percent inhibition of efflux by zosuquidar. The P-gp accumulation and P-gp efflux ratios identify only presence or absence of P-gp activity and are particularly important because they have been described and used RESULTS Patient Demographics and Disease Characteristics Bone marrow aspirates from 50 elderly patients with newly diagnosed AML were analyzed for this study, 32 from E3999 and 18 from KAN-979 (Table 2). A modestly distinguishing feature between the two cohorts was the proportion of samples deemed positive for Pgp, 56% P-gp-positive for E3999 samples and 72% for the KAN-979 cohort. This was by design, since accumulation and efflux results had been obtained for the KAN-979 trial, and it was desired that more results of Pgp- negative also be obtained. Detailed descriptions of patients in studies E3999 and KAN-979 have been previously published (26,27). Identification of Four Leukemic Blast MDR Phenotypes with Accumulation and Efflux Bioassays Bone marrow specimens of the AML patients were simultaneously tested for leukemic blast activities in the accumulation and efflux bioassays by flow cytometry, using DiOC2 MFI values as indicators of MDR-substrate movement into and out of the blast populations. Zosuquidar was used as a P-gp-selective modulator, allowing for identification of district MDR phenotypes of leukemic blasts based on substrate (DiOC2) retention or efflux under different conditions. Four functional MDR phenotypes of AML blast specimens were identified using the accumulation and efflux bioassays as illustrated by four respective bone marrow samples in panels A–D of Figure 1. Panel A illustrates the responses of a representative AML specimen with only appreciable P-gp activity in the bioassays. In the accumulation bioassay, untreated blasts cultured in medium alone exhibited a MFI of 328, while zosuquidar-treated cells had a MFI of 1,945. This yielded a P-gp accumulation ratio of 5.93 (ratio = 1,945  328 = 5.93). P-gp accumulation ratio values from this study of 50 AML specimens ranged from 0.94 to 10.99, with increasing ratios indicative of increasing P-gp function. The distinction between P-gp-positive and P-gpnegative specimens as defined by this bioassay will be addressed subsequently. Basically, accumulation ratios ≥1.30 identify specimens with blasts exhibiting appreciable P-gp function as described previously (26,30). Efflux bioassay results with this P-gp-positive specimen are also shown in Panel A. The blasts were loaded with DiOC2 as evidenced by a MFI of 2,796 in the 4C control group. Blast MFI was reduced to 185 following 37C incubation for 90 min, reflecting 93% efflux. Zosuquidar totally inhibited efflux as indicated by the MFI of 2,825, which was not appreciably different from that It should be noted that almost all samples in this study exhibited some degree of efflux at 37C incubation. This dye movement across the plasma membrane is due to an ill-defined mix of active pumping mechanisms and passive flux. This was expected from other studies where it has been concluded that efflux <40% is considered nonspecific because it is low, variable, and resistant to inhibition by efflux modulators like CsA (27,28,31). For the purposes of this study, samples that exhibited ≥40% dye loss are considered efflux-positive by definition. Panel B of Figure 1 illustrates the minimal responses of an AML blast specimen lacking appreciable P-gp and other MDR activities in the bioassays (double negative). The blasts exhibited nearly identical DiOC2 MFI in the absence and presence of zosuquidar using the accumulation bioassay, yielding an accumulation P-gp ratio of 1.00. This representative blast specimen exhibited little efflux at 37C as demonstrated by 18% total dye efflux, which was not appreciably modulated by culture with zosuquidar (17% total dye efflux and P-gp efflux ratio of 1.03). Double negative specimens accounted for 24% (12 of 50) of all specimens. Panel C of Figure 1 shows representative efflux responses of a P-gp-negative blast population, with substantial zosuquidar-resistant MDR functionality. Results with the P-gp accumulation bioassay were negative bases on the accumulation ratio of 1.13. For the efflux bioassay, appreciable dye loading was evident (MFI 2,246), as was unimpeded 37C efflux (MFI 743, 67% efflux vs. baseline). Significantly, parallel cultures of these blasts demonstrated substantial efflux in the presence of zosuquidar, and comparable dye loss (67%) was observed versus the unimpeded 37C group (P-gp efflux ratio = 1.00). This zosuquidar-resistant efflux activity is presumably not mediated by P-gp and, since it was inhibited in the 4C cultures, is likely energy-dependent activity of other transporters. This phenotype of P-gp-negative, other MDR-positive accounted for 14% (7 of 50) of all specimens. Panel D of Figure 1 shows an example blast specimen with both P-gp and non-P-gp MDR activities. The specimen was clearly P-gp-positive by the accumulation bioassay (P-gp accumulation ratio = 2.64). Ninety-three percent efflux was observed, which was only partially modulated (48%) by zosuquidar. Thus, the sample is Pgp- positive, and has zosuquidar-resistant efflux activity too. This phenotype accounted for 16% (8 of 50) of all specimens, although 26% (8 of 31) of P-gp-positive specimens. The P-gp Accumulation and Efflux Ratios Are Highly Correlated and Comparably Identify Patient Samples as Being Positive or Negative for Blasts with P-gp Function Figure 2 presents the correlation between P-gp ratios obtained with the accumulation and efflux bioassays for the entire patient sample population (N = 50). These measures were highly related as indicated by an R2 of 0.8182 (P < 0.0001) for the overall data set. It has been previously reported that samples with zosuquidardependent accumulation ratios <1.30 can be considered negative for P-gp function (26,30). This ratio cut-point value was used to differentiate P-gp-positive from P-gpnegative samples for this study. Nineteen of the 50 tested samples (38%) in this study exhibited an accumulation ratio < 1.30 (i.e., P-gp-negative) and are depicted as open symbols in Figures 2–4 to allow for monitoring of this population across bioassays and calculations. Results with the corresponding P-gp efflux bioassay ratios for these 19 samples were complicated by the outlier (Grubb’s test) efflux result identified by the arrow in Figure 2. Excluding that outlier sample yielded a P-gp efflux ratio mean (standard dev.) of 1.127  0.136 and an upper 95% confidence interval of 1.38 as a cut-point for differentiation between P-gp-negative versus P-gp-positive samples with the efflux bioassay. The P-gp accumulation and efflux cut-points are identified by the inset box shown in Figure 2. These results confirm that the P-gp ratios for the accumulation and efflux assays identify the same set of samples as Pgp- positive versus P-gp-negative as defined herein. Consequently, all conclusions using samples designated as P-gp-negative or P-gp-positive by the accumulation assay are considered applicable to conclusions with the efflux method. Identification of Independent and Concomitant P-gp and Non-P-gp MDR Functions by AML Blasts with the Accumulation and Efflux Bioassays Panel A of Figure 3 shows the correlation between the accumulation P-gp ratio and percent unimpeded 37C efflux (i.e., without zosuquidar). Almost all samples (97%) deemed P-gp-positive by the accumulation assay (closed symbols) exhibited substantial (≥40%) unimpeded 37C efflux. The samples start to register as P-gp-positive by the P-gp accumulation ratio (i.e., ratio ≥ 1.30) at ~40% efflux (Fig. 3, vertical lines panels A and B). These results corroborate the contention that ≥40% efflux is a reasonable demarcation between efflux-positive versus nonspecific dye movement as described previously (27,28,31). It is readily apparent as illustrated by the open symbols in quadrant IV of Panel A that a substantial percentage of P-gpnegative samples (9 of 19, 47%) also exhibited appreciable unimpeded (≥40%) efflux. Panel B of Figure 3 shows the relationships between the P-gp accumulation ratio and percent efflux in the presence of zosuquidar for P-gp-positive and P-gpnegative populations. Two important observations were revealed. First, as shown by quadrant III, a substantial percentage of samples with P-gp-positive blasts (8 of 31, 26%) exhibited positive (>40%) efflux in the presence of zosuquidar (i.e., zosuquidar-resistant MDR efflux). It remains to be determined whether such expression of multiple MDR species reflects concomitant function by individual blasts, or if subsets of the total blast population preferentially express one or the other individual MDR pumps. Nevertheless, the second key finding in Panel B of Figure 3 is that non-P-gp MDR activity was also observed in an appreciable subpopulation of P-gpnegative samples (quadrant IV, 7 of 19, 37%), with somewhat more substantial non-P-gp efflux (upwards of 80%+) than observed with the closed symbol P-gppositive fraction in quadrant III (40–60%+). These findings of zosuquidar-resistant MDR activities in P-gppositive and P-gp–negative blast samples have potentially important implications for design of companion diagnostics with P-gp modulators like zosuquidar as addressed in the Discussion. Stratification of AML Patients Based on Efflux Activities for CD34+ Blasts in the Absence and Presence of Zosuquidar Figure 4 shows the relationships between unimpeded dye efflux at 37C versus efflux in the presence of zosuquidar as exhibited by this set of samples. Quadrant I identifies blasts with low DiOC2 efflux activity (<40%) in the presence and absence of zosuquidar. Quadrant II would represent cells capable of efflux specimens did not exhibit efflux or because the efflux observed was resistant to zosuquidar. Quadrant IV illustrates specimens from the optimal target patient population for zosuquidar, patients with blasts capable of ≥40% DiOC2 efflux when zosuquidar is absent (37C efflux), but which display <40% efflux in the presence of drug. Model Companion Diagnostic Scenarios with Single and Two-Step Diagnostic Processes Based on MDR Bioassays Table 3 presents two scenarios involving AML patient selection for a hypothetical MDR modulator clinical trial with a single versus two-step companion diagnostic algorithm using sample data from these 50 AML specimens. This analysis is a comparison of blast sample characteristics for patients that would be selected based on a P-gp-restricted companion diagnostic for zosuquidar, versus specimen/patient selection following a secondary determination based on zosuquidar-resistant (non-P-gp) efflux activities. Groups 1 and 2 of Table 3 show results from a single-step P-gp selection process using either the zosuquidar P-gp accumulation or efflux bioassay. Group 1, shown as open symbols in Figures 2–4 and considered P-gp-negative, totaled 19 patients (38% of initial screened patients). P-gp-positive Group 2 totaled 31 patients, 62% of the total screened population. As demonstrated in Figures 3 and 4, both of these groups included patients with blasts having appreciable zosuquidar-resistant MDR function, which could compromise interpretations of zosuquidar AML experiments or clinical trials. samples following the primary screen. Twenty-six percent (8/31, 26%) of P-gp-positive specimens also exhibited zosuquidar-resistant efflux activity. Exclusion of these zosuquidar-resistant samples/patients would yield 23 selected patients from an original cohort of 31 patients with P-gp-positive blasts identified with the initial P-gp screen. Collectively, this secondary determination would have identified 15 of 50 total patient specimens (30% of total) as having zosuquidar-resistant MDR activities, which should be accounted for in companion diagnostic or pharmacodynamics biomarker evaluations of this drug. DISCUSSION This analysis of 50 AML specimens for MDR function using zosuquidar, a P-gp-selective modulator, and two ex vivo leukemic blast bioassays confirms the heterogeneous nature of MDR efflux pump function by AML blasts. Moreover, it supports the supposition that function of multiple transporters could have circumvented or obscured efficacy of P-gp modulators in AML clinical trials like E3999 with zosuquidar, and offers clues to the design of companion diagnostic strategies that take into account redundancy or compensatory drug resistance mechanisms that can allow tumor cell escape from chemotherapy. Activities of at least two functional MDR species were distinguished in the present studies based on differential sensitivity to inhibition with zosuquidar, a potent and selective P-gp-modulator (18–21). Earlier studies by Paietta et al. (28) and Leith et al. (29) provided evidence for P-gp and non-P-gp efflux activities by AML blasts from patients similar to those in the present study. However, this is the first study of its kind using zosuquidar as a means to allow non-P-gp efflux to be observed with full concurrent P-gp inhibition. AML blast samples identified in the present studies as P-gpnegative by either the zosuquidar accumulation or efflux ratio method often contained blasts capable of zosuquidar-resistant MDR efflux activities. Moreover, a significant fraction of samples that were identified as Pgp- positive by these screening bioassays also exhibited zosuquidar-resistant efflux. It would be reasonable to speculate that patients with a preponderance of leukemic blasts capable of zosuquidar-resistant MDR activity would not exhibit clinical efficacy from treatment with P-gpmodulators like zosuquidar in combination with P-gp substrate chemotherapeutic drugs (e.g., anthracyclines). The identity of non-P-gp efflux molecule(s) documented by these studies remains a matter for speculation, especially considering the existence of ~48 ABC transporter genes in humans (6). However, known MDR specificities for zosuquidar and fluorescent probes offer clues concerning the more studied efflux pumps. MRP1, MRP2, and BCRP are not inhibited by zosuquidar (18–21), suggesting a potential role in the zosuquidar-resistant MDR activity observed in this study. It has been observed that BCRP does not substantially efflux DiOC2 (32,33), ruling out that MDR molecule as the zosuquidar-resistant efflux pump documented by these studies. However, a contribution of BCRP to failed zosuquidar clinical trials has not been ruled out. The controversy remains whether MRP1 or MRP2 can efflux DiOC2. It has been observed that DiOC2 is not effluxed by cells expressing MPR-1 (32,33), but that Rh123, a known substrate for MRP1, was extruded by the cells (32). This observation was called into question more recently (34), where it was demonstrated that P-gp and MRP1 can exhibit very similar substrate specificities, including efflux of DiOC2. Thus, MRP1 and MRP2 (among other MDR species) remain candidates for the zosuquidar-resistant MDR efflux mediator(s) detected in the present experiments. Additional studies will be needed using MDR modulators with specificities other than P-gp and more specific fluorescent dyes as proposed by others (e.g., 33,34), to dissect and identify relevant transporter mechanisms. The advent of flow cytometry with mass spectrometry capacity offers the ability to directly monitor the intracellular fate of specific chemotherapeutic drugs in oncology versus surrogate dyes. This should circumvent the problem of low fluorescence utility with many oncology drugs, which is the rationale for using the surrogate dyes in the MDR functional bioassays as used herein. The collective clinical trial findings with P-gp modulators in AML indicate that other MDR species expressed by leukemic blasts will have to be addressed either pharmaceutically or diagnostically for the strategy to be successful (1,2). This hypothesis reconciles the limited successes and failures of clinical trials involving P-gp modulation in AML. The medicinal chemistry approach for addressing Pgp in oncology culminated in the development of third generation modulators like zosuquidar. The fact that zosuquidar minimally altered PK of concurrently administered chemotherapeutics (22–27) allowed for testing of P-gp modulation without the need to reduce chemotherapy dosages. Nevertheless, as demonstrated by AML trial E3999 (27), and corroborated by other studies with third generation P-gp modulators (1,2,4), zosuquidar administered in combination with standard induction therapy in elderly AML patients, failed to demonstrate efficacy in P-gp-positive and P-gp-negative patient populations. It was concluded from E3999 (27) that “Z did not improve outcome in older AML, in part, due to the presence P-gp independent mechanisms of resistance.” Targeting multiple MDR mechanisms with a broader-spectrum modulator has been suggested (1,2). A prevailing hypothesis relates heterogeneity in MDR mechanisms to the ineffectiveness of P-gp modulators like zosuquidar to significantly influence P-gp-positive AML as used in E3999 and KAN-979 (1,2), as reviewed in the Introduction. The substantial utility of P-gp as a prognostic indicator for response to therapy strongly suggests that neutralization of P-gp function should have a positive influence on AML outcomes. Pharmacodynamic studies with autologous plasma bioassay cultures established that P-gp function can be >90% neutralized in P-gp-positive NK cells and leukemic blasts in zosuquidar-infused AML patients concurrent with chemotherapy (26,30). These observations of apparently strong P-gp involvement in AML outcomes, but lack of obvious effect with P-gp neutralization by zosuquidar, indicates a possible role for other MDR mechanisms in escape from therapy. The studies presented herein have identified heretofore undescribed, zosuquidar-resistant MDR efflux activities by leukemic blasts in samples from study E3999, suggesting a plausible relationship between zosuquidar-resistant MDR blast function with the lack of observed efficacy for the drug in that study. Further analyses of results and cryopreserved specimens from clinical studies such as E3999 and KAN-979 could identify processes that promote AML drug-resistance when P-gp has been apparently neutralized. CONCLUSIONS A challenge has emerged for developing effective oncology predictive biomarkers, using methods to detect multiple, and interrelated resistance mechanisms. The results reported herein illustrate this concept of redundant or compensatory drug resistance mechanisms in leukemic blasts, and an approach to incorporating detection of such resistance mechanisms in the design of companion diagnostics.

10	2013	Cancer drug resistance: an evolving paradigm	Abstract | Resistance to chemotherapy and molecularly targeted therapies is a major problem facing current cancer research. The mechanisms of resistance to ‘classical’ cytotoxic chemotherapeutics and to therapies that are designed to be selective for specific molecular targets share many features, such as alterations in the drug target, activation of prosurvival pathways and ineffective induction of cell death. With the increasing arsenal of anticancer agents, improving preclinical models and the advent of powerful high-throughput screening techniques, there are now unprecedented opportunities to understand and overcome drug resistance through the clinical assessment of rational therapeutic drug combinations and the use of predictive biomarkers to enable patient stratification. for cancer, but the effectiveness of chemotherapy is limited by drug resistance. Resistance to chemotherapeutics can be divided into two broad categories: intrinsic or acquired. Intrinsic resistance indicates that before receiving chemotherapy, resistance-mediating factors pre-exist in the bulk of tumour cells that make the therapy ineffective. Acquired drug resistance can develop during treatment of tumours that were initially sensitive and can be caused by mutations arising during treatment, as well as through various other adaptive responses, such as increased expression of the therapeutic target and activation of alternative compensatory signalling pathways1. Moreover, it is increasingly recognized that tumours can contain a high degree of molecular heterogeneity2, thus drug resistance can arise through therapy-induced selection of a resistant minor subpopulation of cells that was present in the original tumour. The use of modern genomic, proteomic and functional analytical techniques has resulted in a substantial increase in our ability to identify novel genes and signalling networks that are involved in determining the responsiveness of tumours to a particular drug treatment. Moreover, the use of high-throughput techniques in combination with bioinformatics and systems biology approaches has aided the interrogation of clinical samples and allowed the identification of molecular signatures and genotypes that predict responses to certain drugs. In addition, such approaches can identify novel therapeutic targets for overcoming or bypassing drug resistance. A diverse range of molecular mechanisms have been implicated in drug resistance; these include increased rates of drug efflux, alterations in drug metabolism and mutation of drug targets1,3–5. Tumours are highly adaptable, and the activation of survival signalling pathways and the inactivation of downstream death signalling pathways can also lead to drug resistance6,7. Epigenetic changes and the influence of the local tumour microenvironment have also been identified as important contributors to chemoresistance8,9. More recently, treatment failure in certain settings has been attributed to the presence of cancer stem cells (BOX 1), which are intrinsically highly resistant to many therapeutic approaches10. Moreover, the increasingly recognized molecular and genetic heterogeneity that is present in many tumours2 is another major problem that can contribute substantially to resistance. As our understanding of the molecular biology of cancer has advanced, drug development has shifted towards agents that target specific molecular alterations in tumours. These ‘molecularly targeted therapies’ have had varying degrees of success because a diverse range of resistance mechanisms have limited patient responses. Importantly, the mechanisms of resistance to cytotoxic chemotherapies and targeted drugs largely overlap, thus knowledge gained from earlier research into the mechanisms of resistance to cytotoxic drugs can be applied to help anticipate and elucidate mechanisms of resistance to emerging molecularly targeted agents. Although toxicity to normal tissues and pharmacokinetic effects such as drug solubility, systemic distribution, metabolism and elimination are all important factors that can limit the amount of drug reaching the tumour effectiveness of current cancer therapies. • Toxicity to normal tissues limits the amount of drug that can be systemically administered, and pharmacokinetic effects (absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination (ADME)) limit the amount of drug that reaches the tumour. • At the level of the tumour, various resistance mechanisms can operate, such as increased drug efflux, mutations of the drug target, DNA damage repair, activation of alternative signalling pathways and evasion of cell death. • Tumour resistance can be intrinsic (that is, present before treatment), or acquired during treatment by various therapy-induced adaptive responses. • Tumours are heterogeneous; therefore, resistance can also arise by positive selection of a drug-resistant tumour subpopulation. • High-throughput screening techniques and systems biology approaches have the power to identify novel mechanisms of drug resistance and molecular signatures and genotypes that predict tumour response. • Increasingly, predictive biomarkers will be used clinically to stratify patients to receive specific therapeutics. • Improved understanding of the molecular basis of resistance will inevitably lead to the clinical assessment of rational drug combinations in selected patient populations. of MDR)13. MDR1 overexpression has been associated with chemotherapy failure in many cancers, including kidney, colon and liver cancers, as well as leukaemias and lymphomas. More recently, the overexpression of MRP1 has also been correlated with chemoresistance in prostate, lung and breast cancer14,15,16. BCRP, which was the third major MDR drug efflux pump to be identified, has been associated with chemoresistance in breast cancer and leukaemia17,18. Recent reports have suggested that molecularly targeted therapies such as imatinib, erlotinib, sunitinib and nilotinib (TABLE 2) are also substrates for and modulators of MDR1 and BCRP19. Cancer stem cells, which are inherently drug resistant, also display higher levels of drug efflux proteins20. CD44, which is a cancer stem cell marker that exhibits strong negative correlations with patient survival21, has been associated with expression of MDR proteins, most notably BCRP. However, as these cells persist after treatment with drugs that are not MDR substrates, it seems that efflux mechanisms may not be crucial to the drug-resistant phenotype displayed by cancer stem cells. MDR1 inhibitors such as zosuquidar and tariquidar have high potency and specificity; however, results from clinical trials have been disappointing. Tariquidar showed limited activity in combination with an anthracycline or taxanes in a small cohort of women with stage III–IV breast carcinoma22, whereas a Phase II study in breast cancer found no additional benefit in overall survival, progression-free survival or response rates when zosuquidar was co‑administered with docetaxel23. Taken at face value, this suggests that the contribution of MDR proteins to clinical drug resistance may be less important than preclinical models have suggested; however, it is also possible that the ABC transporter family exhibits a high degree of functional redundancy. Indeed, one study of of MDR)13. MDR1 overexpression has been associated with chemotherapy failure in many cancers, including kidney, colon and liver cancers, as well as leukaemias and lymphomas.

Taken at face value, this suggests that the contribution of MDR proteins to clinical drug resistance may be less important than preclinical models have suggested; however, it is also possible that the ABC transporter family exhibits a high degree of functional redundancy. Indeed, one study of features that make a drug a substrate for ABC transporters may allow the avoidance of such features to be factored into medicinal chemistry during the development of new anticancer drugs. Drug activation and inactivation. Other upstream resistance mechanisms, which are relevant for both chemotherapeutics and molecularly targeted agents, are drug inactivation or a lack of drug activation. Such mechanisms are highly specific for each class of drug; for example, platinum drugs can be inactivated by the thiol glutathione25, and the conversion of antimetabolites such as 5‑fluorouracil (5‑FU) and methotrexate to their most active forms does not occur when the relevant cellular enzyme activities are absent26,27. Capecitabine is a fluoropyrimidine prodrug that is converted into 5‑FU by thymidine phosphorylase28. The gene encoding thymidine phosphorylase can be inactivated by methylation, thereby causing capecitabine resistance29. However, this epigenetic silencing is tumour-specific and can be reversed by treatment with inhibitors of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs). Epigenetic silencing can also promote drug activity, as observed in the case of the topoisomerase I inhibitor irinotecan, which is inactivated by UDP glucuronosyltransferase 1 (UGT1A1); expression of UGT1A1 is negatively regulated by DNA methylation of the promoter. Therefore, in this case, promoter methylation promotes irinotecan activity30,31. Alterations in drug targets Drug response and resistance can be affected by alterations to the drug target, such as mutations or changes in expression level. Examples of this are thymidylate synthase inhibitors such as 5‑FU and pemetrexed32, which post-transcriptionally upregulate thymidylate synthase expression owing to the inhibition of a negative feedback loop in which substrate-free thymidylate synthase binds to and inhibits the translation of thymidylate synthase mRNA. Another example is the androgen receptor (AR), which is genomically amplified in ~30% of prostate cancers that have developed acquired resistance to standard androgen deprivation therapy using testosteronelowering drugs such as leuprolide and AR antagonists such as bicalutamide33. In both cases, increased drug target expression reduces the effectiveness of inhibitors of these targets because more target molecules be must be inhibited to have a therapeutic effect. Cancers are often highly dependent on specific oncogenic mutations that occur in kinases; however, the outgrowth of cells with gatekeeper residue mutations is a common mechanism of resistance to agents that target these oncogenic kinases. For example, high response rates to inhibitors of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) such as gefitinib and erlotinib in non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) with activating mutations in the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain (in‑frame deletions in exon 19 and the L858R mutation in exon 21) have been reported34. However, most patients with initial responses acquire resistance within 1 year, and in 50% of such cases, a secondary EGFR-T790M gatekeeper mutation has been identified35–37. Chromosomal rearrangements and/or other genetic alterations, such as amplification and mutations in anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) have been identified in anaplastic large-cell lymphoma and paediatric neuroblastoma, as well as in 4% of patients with NSCLC38–41. Tumour responses of ~60% to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) crizotinib, which inhibits ALK Drug resistance due to gatekeeper mutations in oncogenic kinases is clearly an important clinical challenge. A new BCR–ABL1 inhibitor, ponatinib, has shown promising efficacy in patients whose leukaemias harbour the T315I mutation and is also active against other BCR–ABL1 mutations49–51. Second-generation, irreversible EGFR TKIs — such as HKI‑272, afatinib and PF00299804 — are currently being assessed in Phase I/II clinical trials. However, although these drugs are active in patients with NSCLCs that have the EGFR-T790M mutation, there are toxicity issues associated with the activity of these drugs against wild-type EGFR52,53. A recent study using cell-based screening methods has identified a novel class of inhibitors that do not inhibit wild-type EGFR but are active against the T790M‑mutated form, thus these inhibitors may have fewer adverse side effects54. It will be interesting to determine whether the new generation of BCR–ABL1 and EGFR inhibitors encounter targetassociated mechanisms of resistance that are similar to the previous generation. DNA damage repair Many chemotherapeutic drugs induce DNA damage either directly (for example, platinum-based drugs) or indirectly (for example, topoisomerase inhibitors). The cellular response to DNA damage is repair or cell death; therefore, the DNA damage repair capacity of cancer cells has a major influence on the effectiveness of DNA-damaging drugs. The role of DNA damage repair in drug resistance was recently reviewed in this journal55, so we will only briefly discuss it here. DNA damage induces cell cycle arrest, which has evolved to allow cells time to repair the damage. In some cancers, the regulation of cell cycle arrest is disrupted owing to gain‑of‑function alterations to oncogenes and/ or loss-of-function alterations to tumour suppressor genes. For example, mutation of p53, which has an important role in regulating numerous cell cycle checkpoints can disrupt DNA-damage-induced cell cycle arrest56. p53 is also involved in the induction of apoptosis, and its mutation is frequently associated with drug resistance57. Inhibiting DNA damage repair in cancer cells is an obvious therapeutic strategy to combine with DNAdamaging agents. Moreover, cancers frequently have a dysfunction in at least one DNA damage repair pathway, which can lead to complete dependence on an alternative repair pathway that is functionally redundant in normal cells and therefore can be inhibited to induce cancer-cell-specific death; this is the concept of synthetic lethality, which is described in detail elsewhere58. Thus, molecularly targeted agents that inhibit components of the DNA damage response machinery have been developed, such as inhibitors of the single-strand-break DNA repair enzyme poly(ADP–ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1), which have been shown to exhibit synthetic lethality in breast and ovarian tumours harbouring mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes59. BRCA1- or BRCA2‑mutant cells are sensitive to treatment with PARP1 inhibitors owing to their impaired homologous recombination DNA repair pathways, which normally compensate for loss of PARP1 activity. However, resistance has been reported in BRCA2‑mutant tumours treated with PARP inhibitors due to in‑frame deletions in BRCA2 that partially restore its DNA repair function, thereby allowing these cells to survive treatment60,61. The mismatch repair (MMR) system is crucial for maintaining genomic integrity, and mutations in MMR genes such as MLH1 and MSH2 can lead to the microsatellite instability (MSI) phenotype. Moreover, MMR deficiency has been linked to the resistance to various cytotoxic chemotherapies; for example, hypermethylation of MLH1 has been reported to cause resistance to cisplatin and carboplatin62. Conversely, a synthetic lethal interaction between MSH2‑targeted short interfering RNA (siRNA) and methotrexate was identified in MMR-deficient cancer cells; methotrexate caused the accumulation of oxidative lesions such as 8‑oxoguanine (8‑oxoG) in MSH2‑deficient cells, which resulted in a loss of viability through apoptosis63. This has led to an on-going Phase II clinical trial with methotrexate in patients with MSH2‑deficient metastatic colorectal cancer using measurement of 8‑oxoG lesions as a biomarker of DNA damage caused by many DNA-damaging drugs, such as platinum-based drugs64. One of the crucial components of the NER pathway is excision repair crosscomplementing 1 (ERCC1). High expression of ERCC1 has been linked with poor responses to chemotherapy in numerous cancer types, including NSCLC, gastric cancer and ovarian cancer65,66. Notably, testicular cancers, which are very sensitive to cisplatin treatment, have very low levels of ERCC1 (REF. 67). Genomic instability is a hallmark of cancer and can lead to increased tumour heterogeneity and resistance to both chemotherapies and molecularly targeted therapies. Chromosomal instability (CIN), which comprises changes in chromosome number and structure, is the most common form of genomic instability. Preclinical studies have indicated a role for CIN in both acquired and intrinsic resistance to certain chemotherapeutics such as taxanes68,69. A recent study has highlighted the importance of CIN in drug resistance by demonstrating that the overexpression of CIN genes (that is, genes that are involved in maintaining the genomic integrity of the cell) was associated with poor survival in myeloma and in seven other cancers that were examined70,71. Of these genes, a strong association was found for NEK2, which encodes a serine/threonine mitotic kinase that has roles in spindle formation and chromosome segregation70,71. In addition, silencing of NEK2 in vitro and in vivo inhibited cell growth and decreased resistance to the targeted proteasome inhibitor bortezomib. The mechanism of NEK2‑mediated drug resistance was further demonstrated to be through AKT–mediated upregulation of ABC transporters. Downstream resistance mechanisms After sufficient active drug has accumulated and inhibited its cellular target or targets, the outcome of treatment is dependent on how the cancer cell responds. This is equally true for both classical cytotoxic drugs (FIG. 2a) and the newer molecularly targeted agents (FIG. 2b). Ideally, drug-induced damage should be tightly coupled to the induction of cell death. However, numerous intrinsic adaptive responses can be triggered that promote cancer cell survival. In addition, as part of the process of transformation, the pathways that regulate cell death by apoptosis frequently become dysfunctional; this is one of the classic hallmarks of cancer72. Deregulation of apoptosis. There is accumulating evidence that although resistance to apoptosis is a hallmark of cancer and can cause resistance to drug treatment, cancer cells are typically ‘addicted’ to a fairly small number of anti-apoptotic proteins for their survival73, providing a strong rationale for targeting these proteins therapeutically. Most prominent among these are the anti-apoptotic BCL‑2 family members, inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) and the caspase 8 inhibitor FLIP (FIG. 3). Mutations, amplifications, chromosomal translocations and overexpression of the genes encoding these proteins by BCL‑2. Various other BCL‑2 family proteins have since been demonstrated to have roles in regulating chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. These include the anti-apoptotic BCL‑2 family members (such as BCL‑XL and MCL1) and pro-apoptotic family members (such as BAX, BAD and BAK, as well as various BH3‑only proteins that can antagonize the anti-apoptotic BCL‑2 family members)76–78. It is the interplay between members of this family that is critical in determining the fate of the cell by either inhibiting or facilitating MOMP induction79. In a recent study, a crucial role for BCL‑2 family proteins in determining whether patients respond to conventional chemotherapy was demonstrated. Using a method called BH3 profiling, which measures how ‘primed’ a cell is to committing to apoptosis, they were able to show that the level of mitochondrial priming correlated with clinical response to chemotherapy across a range of malignancies80. This indicates that BCL‑2 family proteins have a pivotal role in dictating cell fate following chemotherapy treatment. It remains to be seen whether BH3 profiling will also predict responses to targeted therapies. The BH3‑only protein BIM has been identified as a central player in both imatinib-induced apoptosis in CML and also in gefitinib- and erlotinib-induced apoptosis in EGFR-mutated NSCLC81–83. Increased BIM expression is induced following the inhibition of AKT and ERK that occurs in response to these TKIs. More recently, BIM levels have been demonstrated to predict clinical responsiveness to inhibitors of EGFR, ERBB2 (also known as HER2) or PI3K84. Moreover, a germline deletion in the gene encoding BIM has been identified in an East Asian population of patients and has been significantly associated with intrinsic resistance to TKI therapies in both chronic-phase CML and EGFR-mutant lung cancer85. Recently, substantial progress has been made in generating pharmacological inhibitors of anti-apoptotic BCL‑2 family members as anticancer therapies. The best studied and most successful of these is ABT‑737 and its orally bioavailable form ABT‑263 (also known as navitoclax), which mimic the action of BH3‑only BCL‑2 family members by antagonizing the anti-apoptotic function of BCL‑2, BCL‑XL and BCL‑W and promoting the pro-apoptotic function of BAX and BAK86 (FIG. 3). Preclinical data indicate that ABT‑737 and ABT‑263 exhibit cytotoxicity when combined with chemotherapies or radiation87 and display single-agent effectiveness against various tumour types87,88. However, resistance mechanisms limit the effectiveness of these agents, most notably due to another antiapoptotic BCL‑2 family member, MCL1. ABT‑737 binds weakly to MCL1, and resistance has been observed in cells that express MCL1 (REFS 86,88,89), whereas silencing of MCL1 has been shown to restore sensitivity to ABT‑737 (REF. 90). MCL1 is clearly an important determinant of resistance to ABT‑737 and is also an important mediator of resistance to cytotoxic chemotherapeutics. Various strategies aimed at targeting MCL1 are being investigated; some of these are aimed at exploiting a feature of MCL1 that is not shared with other anti-apoptotic BCL‑2 family members: it has an extremely short halflife due to its degradation by the ubiquitin–proteasome system. Thus, enzymes that are involved in regulating MCL1 degradation may prove to be useful therapeutic targets91,92. Obatoclax, which is a synthetic derivative of prodiginines, was initially thought to be a pan-BCL‑2 inhibitor and was discovered in a high-throughput screen of natural compounds that inhibit protein–protein interactions in the BCL‑2 family93. Obatoclax has high affinity for all anti-apoptotic members of the BCL‑2 family, including MCL1; however, it is not entirely dependent on BAX and BAK to induce apoptosis, indicating that obatoclax may also affect other pathways to induce apoptosis94. More recently, MCL1‑selective inhibitors have been developed using the same fragment-based design approach that was used to develop ABT‑737 (REF. 95). This powerful medicinal chemistry approach has the potential to deliver clinically relevant small molecules for difficult drug targets, such as protein–protein interactions, and therefore substantially widens the scope of proteins that can be considered ‘druggable’. Recombinant forms of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)- related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and agonistic antibodies that recognize either death receptor 4 (DR4; also known as TRAILR1) or DR5 (also known as TRAILR2) have been developed. These pro-apoptotic receptor agonists have demonstrated antitumour activity in vitro and in xenograft models; however, the results of clinical trials of both recombinant TRAIL and TRAILreceptor- targeted agonistic antibodies as monotherapies have been disappointing. Despite a lack of clinical activity as monotherapies (at least in unselected patient populations), combinations of TRAIL receptor agonists with both chemotherapeutics and targeted therapies — such as paclitaxel, carboplatin, bevacizumab, BCL‑2 antagonists, histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors and various kinase inhibitors — are currently being evaluated in preclinical and clinical trials and are showing promise96,97. Numerous drugs that have been shown to restore TRAIL sensitivity do so by decreasing the expression of the caspase 8 inhibitor FLIP, which is not only a major regulator of the pathway to apoptosis that is triggered by binding of death ligands to death receptors, but also of apoptosis that is induced by various chemotherapeutic agents98. Importantly, normal cells do not seem to be dependent on FLIP for survival to the same extent as cancer cells99. As such, inhibition of FLIP constitutes a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of numerous cancer types. At present, there are no specific inhibitors for FLIP; however, HDAC inhibitors seem to be highly effective at downregulating the expression of this short-lived protein through transcriptional and enhanced tumour regression in response to alkylating agents in a mouse model of lymphoma105, and hydroxychloroquine was found to sensitize human cancer cells to cancer therapy106. Resistance-promoting adaptive responses Activation of prosurvival signalling. Numerous studies have reported the activation of EGFR as a resistance mechanism to various chemotherapies107–110. Accordingly, EGFR-targeted therapies have been shown to sensitize various tumour types to agents such as 5‑FU, irinotecan, paclitaxel and TRAIL in vitro and/or in vivo108–110. Moreover, some clinical trials have shown the benefit of the addition of EGFR-targeted therapies to irinotecanbased chemotherapy in KRAS-wild-type colorectal cancer and have led to approvals from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for EGFR-targeted agents in this genetic subtype of colorectal cancer. However, KRAS-mutant colorectal cancer is unresponsive to EGFR inhibitors because oncogenic KRAS is not dependent on upstream activation by EGFR; this is an example of ‘oncogenic bypass’ (see below). ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase) enzymes are zinc-dependent, membrane-associated metalloproteinases that cleave and thereby activate the ligands for various growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs)111,112. Studies from our group have shown that chemotherapy-induced activation of EGFR occurs as a result of an acute ADAM17‑dependent adaptive resistance mechanism110,113. Moreover, inhibition of ADAM17 results in synergistic inhibition of tumour growth when combined with chemotherapy in several cancer models113,114. As ADAM17 regulates the shedding of ligands that activate numerous growth factor receptors, inhibiting its activity may have a more profound therapeutic effect than blocking individual growth factor receptors. Oncogenic bypass and pathway redundancy. Although inhibiting prosurvival signals can increase sensitivity to chemotherapeutics and can exploit tumour addiction to specific gain‑of‑function mutations, the molecularly targeted agents that are used to block these pathways are themselves subject to various adaptive resistance mechanisms. For example, numerous reports have identified ERBB3 (also known as HER3) and downstream signalling through the PI3K–AKT pathway as an important mechanism of adaptive resistance to EGFR-targeted therapies in vitro and in vivo115,116. This mechanism has been termed ‘oncogenic bypass’ or ‘kinome reprogramming’ because the primary drug target remains unaltered and continues to be inhibited, but an alternative kinase becomes activated owing either to an adaptive feedback loop or a genetic mutation that is selected for during treatment; this is emerging as a major mechanism of resistance to the newer molecularly targeted agents (FIG. 4). Amplification of MET, which encodes a protein that drives ERBB3‑dependent activation of PI3K, has been found to cause resistance to EGFR inhibitors in approximately 20% of patients with oncogenic-EGFR-driven lung cancer117. This is another example of oncogenic bypass as MET can compensate for EGFR blockade by activating the downstream effectors of EGFR signalling. The serine/threonine kinase BRAF, which is the kinase immediately downstream of KRAS, is itself frequently activated by mutation in numerous cancers, particularly melanoma. However, unlike KRAS, for which there are currently no direct inhibitors, some inhibitors such as vemurafenib have been developed that target oncogenic BRAF, specifically the most commonly mutated form, BRAF‑V600E. Although clinical response rates to vemurafenib in BRAFV600E-mutated melanoma is high (~50%), secondary resistance invariably develops118. A range of compensatory resistance mechanisms has been identified, including acute adaptive responses (such as the activation of alternative RAF isoforms) and selection of tumour cells with acquired mutations in genes such as KRAS, NRAS and MEK1 (REFS 119–122). In contrast to BRAF-driven melanoma, BRAF inhibitors are less effective in BRAFmutant colorectal cancer; this seems to be due to the activation of an EGFR–AKT signalling axis that results in the intrinsic resistance of this tumour type to BRAF inhibitors123. This is a good example of how tissue type Epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT). Epithelial cells can undergo transition to a mesenchymal phenotype, during which they lose their polarized organization and tight cell–cell junctions and undergo changes in cell shape to develop a fibroblast-like morphology that is associated with increased motility and invasive capacity. This change in cellular phenotype is driven by various transcription factors that regulate the expression of proteins that are involved in cell polarity, cell‑to‑cell contact, cytoskeletal structure and extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation. Recent studies have demonstrated a link between chemotherapy and targeted therapy resistance and the EMT phenotype. For example, resistance to EGFR inhibitors was observed in cell lines undergoing EMT124,125. In the clinic, EMT was also observed in tumour samples from patients with NSCLC who developed resistance to EGFR inhibitors126,127. In addition, two recent studies have identified the RTK AXL as a potential therapeutic target for overcoming EGFR inhibitor resistance that is associated with development of the mesenchymal phenotype128,129. Moreover, a recent study using a large-scale siRNA screen to discover the determinants of response to ALK and EGFR inhibitors identified MED12, which is a component of the Mediator transcription complex that is mutated in cancers. MED12 loss was shown to induce an EMT-like phenotype through the activation of transforming growth factor‑β receptor (TGFβR) signalling, and this change was associated with drug resistance. Notably, inhibition of TGFβR signalling was able to restore drug responsiveness Integrins. Integrins are cell surface adhesion molecules that connect cells to the ECM136. Expression of integrins can be altered in tumour cells, and higher expression is associated with increased cancer cell survival and drug resistance137. Recent findings show that integrin-mediated adhesion to the ECM can modify responses to chemotherapeutic agents by various mechanisms, including inhibition of apoptosis and alterations in drug targets138. Integrins modulate many signalling pathways, including the PI3K–AKT, ERK and NF‑κB pathways that promote cell survival and drug resistance139, thus implying that they may also be important factors in resistance to kinase-targeted agents. This has been demonstrated in ERBB2‑positive metastatic breast cancer in which β1‑integrin expression levels were identified as an independent prognostic biomarker of the response to the ERBB2‑targeted antibody trastuzumab140. Cytokines and growth factors. Autocrine, paracrine and endocrine activation of oncogenic signalling by soluble factors such as cytokines and growth factors can have key roles in resistance to both chemotherapy and molecularly targeted therapies by maintaining the activation of various survival signalling pathways. In one study, a murine model of Burkitt’s lymphoma was used to demonstrate how paracrine factors in the tumour microenvironment can modulate lymphoma cell survival following chemotherapy treatment. Both interleukin 6 (IL‑6) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1 (TIMP1) were released in the thymus in response to doxorubicin treatment, leading to the establishment of what the authors term a ‘chemoresistant niche’, which can in turn lead to survival of residual lymphoma cells and ultimately patient relapse141. A recent study142 used a cell line panel derived from various cancer types to assess the effects of different growth factors on sensitivity to kinase inhibitors. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and neuregulin 1 (NRG1) were all shown to cause drug resistance by reactivating either or both of the PI3K–AKT and MEK–ERK pathways. Inhibition of their corresponding RTKs was able to overcome the growthfactor- mediated drug resistance, but was ineffective as a monotherapy. This type of ligand-mediated therapeutic resistance has been reported in preclinical models, including HGF-induced resistance to vemurafenib in BRAFV600E melanoma models and to the ERBB2 inhibitor lapatinib in ERBB2‑amplified breast cancer cell lines. Clinically, circulating levels of HGF before treatment have been correlated with worse progression-free and overall survival in patients with BRAFV600E melanoma who were treated with vemurafenib. marrow stroma, mammary fibroblasts, cancer-associated fibroblasts (from both the breast and lung), skin and umbilical epithelium, as well as murine adipocytes and fetal fibroblasts. They were co‑cultured with NSCLC, breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, colorectal cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma, and gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST) cell lines. The authors then focused on the BRAF inhibitor PLX4720 and showed that BRAFV600E melanoma cells became resistant to this drug when co‑cultured with fibroblasts, and this was then shown to be due to the presence of HGF in the co‑culture medium. Moreover, the presence of HGF-positive tumour-associated stromal cells correlated with a poorer clinical response of BRAFV600E melanoma to BRAF inhibitors. Notably however, melanoma cell lines could be resensitized to BRAF inhibition in vitro by inhibiting either HGF or its receptor, MET143. Conclusions Despite the daunting range of resistance mechanisms and the complexities caused by tumour heterogeneity and microenvironment interactions, we should not lose sight of the fact that chemotherapeutics and molecularly targeted therapies are effective in many disease settings, significantly prolonging patients’ lives or, in some cases, producing cures. The current challenge is to learn from experiences with traditional cytotoxic drugs and the first wave of molecularly targeted agents to use the increasing arsenal of anticancer therapies in the most effective ways. Rational drug combinations are often proposed on the basis of in vitro and in vivo synergy between agents; however, hitting the same pathway at multiple points may in some cases provide a relatively simple ‘escape route’ for the tumour. Orthogonal therapies that target completely independent pathways may therefore sometimes be a better option as the avenues for the development of tumour drug resistance may be more limited. Most importantly, we need to be able to stratify patients according to whether they are likely to respond to a particular drug or drug combination. The use of powerful high-throughput techniques such as microarray profiling and next-generation sequencing provide an abundance of data that can be used to identify potential predictive biomarkers for patient stratification. However, whether cell lines are the best platform for identifying clinically meaningful biomarkers and evaluating drug combinations is a matter of debate, given the impact of the microenvironment on drug resistance. Although cell lines are often a good starting point, improved in vitro and in vivo models, such as patient-derived xenografts, that more closely model tumour–stroma interactions are clearly needed to more accurately assess drug resistance, evaluate potential drug combinations and determine the therapeutic value of predictive biomarkers. Subsequently, such preclinical studies need to be tested in the clinic, which will require the design of ‘smart’ trials incorporatin	Caitriona Holohan, Sandra Van Schaeybroeck, Daniel B.

11	2015	ABC transporters as multidrug resistance mechanisms and the development of chemosensitizers for their reversal	Abstract One of the major problems related with anticancer chemotherapy is resistance against anticancer drugs. The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters are a family of transporter proteins that are responsible for drug resistance and a low bioavailability of drugs by pumping a variety of drugs out cells at the expense of ATP hydrolysis. One strategy for reversal of the resistance of tumor cells expressing ABC transporters is combined use of anticancer drugs with chemosensitizers. In this review, the physiological functions and structures of ABC transporters, and the development of chemosensitizers are described focusing on well-known proteins including P-glycoprotein, multidrug resistance associated protein, and breast cancer resistance protein One of the major problems related with anticancer chemotherapy is resistance against anticancer drugs. Some cancers such as non-small cancer, lung cancer, and rectal cancer show what is called primary resistance or natural resistance in which they do not respond to standard chemotherapy drugs from the beginning. On the other hand, many types of sensitive tumors respond well to chemotherapy drugs in the beginning but show acquired resistance later. Experimentally, drug resistance could be very specific to the drug used due to abnormal genetic machinery such as gene amplification within tumor cells in many cases. Multidrug resistance (MDR) is especially problematic in acquired drug resistance. MDR is the phenomenon in which cancer cells exposed to one anticancer drug show resistance to various anticancer drugs that are structurally and functionally different from the initial anticancer drug. The most investigated mechanisms with known clinical significance are: a) activation of transmembrane proteins effluxing different chemical substances from the cells; b) activation of the enzymes of the glutathione detoxification system; c) alterations of the genes and the proteins involved into the control of apoptosis (especially p53 and Bcl-2). The cell membrane, cytoplasm, and nuclear protein participate in these resistance mechanisms [1]. The resistance mechanism is called typical MDR or classical MDR when overexpression of the membrane efflux pumps is involved in MDR. The classical MDR is due mostly to increased efflux pumps in the cell membrane of cells pumping anticancer drugs out of cells. The most typical efflux pumps in the cell membrane is Pglycoprotein (Pgp) [2] having the molecular weight of 170 KD, due to the gene amplification of the normal human gene, MDR1. The efflux pump Pgp is responsible for transporting various xenobiotics (not limited to anticancer drugs) out of cells by using ATP (Fig. 1) [3]. Pgp is one of the membrane transporter superfamily having the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) with well-preserved homology of the site where ATP binds. There are more than 100 ABC transporters distributed from prokaryotes to humans. Forty-eight ABC genes have been reported in humans, among which the functions of 16 genes have been determined and 14 genes are related with diseases present in humans (cystic fibrosis, adrenoleukodystrophy, Stargardt's disease, drug-resistant tumors, Dubin- Johnson syndrome, Byler's disease, progressive familiar intrahepatic cholestasis, X-linked sideroblastic anemia, ataxia, and persistent and hyperinsulimenic hypoglycemia in children) http://www.nutrigene.4t.com/ humanabc.htmc[4,5]. Other efflux pumps of the mammalian cell membrane in ABC superfamily include multidrug resistance-associated proteins (MRP) [6] and breast cancer resistance proteins (BCRP; mitoxantrone resistance proteins, MXR) [7,8]. Other than the fact that these resistant proteins belong to the ABC superfamily, they are quite different with respect to gene locus, amino acid sequence, structure and substrate (Table 1 and 2). In this review, the physiological functions and structures of ABC transporters, and development of chemosensitizers are described focusing on well-known proteins including Pgp, MRP, and BCRP. Functions of ABC transporters Although the physiologic functions of ABC transporters are not well known, they are expressed constitutively in not only tumor cells but also normal cells in the digestive system including the small intestine, large intestine, liver, and pancreas; epithelial cells in the kidneys, adrenals, brain, and testes; and endothelial cells (Table 1). From the aspect of the tissue distribution, ABC transporters are thought to participate in the absorption and secretion of endogenous and exogenous substances. Endogenous and exogenous substrates for ABC transporters reported so far are summarized in Table 2. Especially, the ABC transporters have shown to function as an efflux pump for lipid, multiple drugs, natural products and peptides. It is proposed to operate as a hydrophobic vacuum cleaner, expelling non-polar compounds from the membrane bilayer to the exterior, driven by the energy of ATP hydrolysis [143]. ATP-dependent transbilayer lipid transporters are classified into cytofacially-directed flippases and exofaciallydirected floppases. Floppase activity has been associated with the ABC transporters although not all ABC transporters are floppases [144]. Endogenous substrates for Pgp include corticosterone [145], beta-estradiol 17beta-D-glucuronide, an endogenous cholestatic metabolite of estradiol [146], 1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3- phosphocholine (generically platelet-activating factor, PAF) [147], glutamate [148] and endorphin [149]. It was also recently reported that Pgp has the function of removing beta-amyloid, which was reported as the causal substance of Alzheimer's disease [150,151]. MRP1 effluxes various conjugated substrates such as leukotriene C4 conjugates [152], steroid conjugates [153] and the GSH conjugate of aflatoxin B1, which is a mycotoxin [154]. Cells can, upon hypoxic demand, use BCRP to reduce heme or porphyrin accumulation, which can be detrimental to cells [155]. When cancer originates not only from cells normally expressing efflux pump but also cells having genes but not expressing, gene expression is initiated due to the exposure to anticancer drugs, resulting in resistance to anticancer drugs, eventually interfering with chemotherapy. Pgp is mainly present in the apical membrane of intestinal mucosal membrane and lowers bioavailability of drugs by preventing the absorption of the drugs. Digoxin, which shows a low bioavailability and is mainly excreted through stool in normal mice due to poor absorption in the mouse intestine, shows a high bioavailability and mainly excreted through urine in mice with mdr1 knocked out[156]. The bioavailability of the substrate of Pgp, paclitaxel, also increased significantly in mice with mdr1 knocked out and in mice administered with the Pgp MRP1 Estradiol-17beta(beta-D-glucuronide) glutathione, glutathione Sconjugate leukoetriene C4, glucuronosyl bilirubin Anthracyclines, cochicine, etoposide, heavy metals (arsenite, arsenate, antimonials), vincristine, vinblastine, paclitaxel MRP2 Estradiol-17beta(beta-D-glucuronide), glutathione, glutathione Sconjugate Leukoetriene C4, glucuronosyl bilirubin, Cisplatin, CPT-11, doxorubicin, etoposide, methotrexate, SN-38, vincristine, vinblastine MRP3 S-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)glutathione Cisplatin, doxorubicin, etoposide, methotrexate, teniopside, vincristine, MRP4 Glucuronide and glutathione conjugates Methotrexate, nucleotide analogs, PMEA* MRP5 Glutamate and phosphate conjugates Doxorubicin, methotrexate, nucleotide analogs, topotecan, MRP6 Cyclic nucleotides (cAMP, cGMP), glutathione conjugate Doxorubicin, etoposide, teniposide MRP7 ? ? MRP8 17beta-estradiol-(17-beta-D-glucuronide), leukotriene C4, cyclic nucleotides 5'-Fluorouracil, 5'-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine, 5'-fluoro-5'- deoxyuridine, PMEA* B Recently, multiple MDR1 polymorphisms including more than 20 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) have been identified. The mutations at positions 2677(G→T) and 2995(G →A) of MDR1 in normal cells were firstly reported [158]. MDR1 polymorphism could be not only associated with alteration of Pgp expression and/or function, drug disposition and treatment outcome but also increase the risk of diseases such as Parkinson's disease and ulcerative colitis [159]. The influence of MDR1 SNP(C3435T and G2677T) on disposition of Pgp substrates or treatment outcome has been examplified in digoxin, phenytoin, fexofenadine, nelfinarvir, cyclosporine, talinolol and loperamide [159]. Polymorphisms of other ABC transporters have been reported [160-163]. If a substance in food affects Pgp, this substance also could affect the bioavailability of substrate drugs for Pgp. It was reported that substances present in grape juice or orange juice could increase the bioavailability of a drug being the substrate of Pgp by inhibiting it. [164]. These substances could also affect pharmacokinetics of other drugs [160,165]. On the contrary, some drugs could increase the expression of Pgp. St John's Wort used as an antidepressant increases the expression of Pgp, so it could significantly lower the serum concentration of indinavir or cyclosporin [166]. Digoxin is the substrate of Pgp and induces paclitaxel resistance by increasing Pgp [166]. Not only Pgp but also MRP and BCRP could affect the bioavailability of drugs. AMPComparison of nucleotide free-Pgp (nf-Pgp) and Pgp-AMPPNP (Pgp-AMP-PNP) three-dimensional structures.

Nonetheless, various hydrophobic substances could not enter these tissues because they are effluxed out by efflux pumps. Actually, Pgp effluxes neurotransmitters or neuromodulators such as glutamate [148] and opioids [149,167] into blood from the brain. Compared with wild-type mice, drugs beings the substrate of Pgp were significantly increased in the brain of fetus when the mdr1 gene is knocked out in mice [168-171]. When the BCRP inhibitor, GF120918, was introduced to pregnant mice, the topotecan level was increased by two-folds in mouse fetus, suggesting that BCRP would function as the maternal- fetal barrier in the placenta [172]. Thus, quantitative and qualitative changes of transporters present in the membrane could affect pharmacokinetics such as the distribution of endogenous and exogenous substances. Structure of ABC transporters Pgp is a 170-kDa membrane protein glycosylated at the Structure of ABC transporters Pgp is a 170-kDa membrane protein glycosylated at the first extracellular loop (Fig. 1). Pgp is composed of 12 hydrophobic transmembrane domains (TMDs) and 2 nucleotide-binding domain (NBD). One NBD connects two TMDs with a hydrophilic NBD loop. TDMs form of substrate, and efflux substrate drugs whereas NBDs are located in the interior of cytoplasm, and participate in ATP binding and hydrolysis [173]. Pgp undergoes conformational changes upon binding of nucleotide to the NBDs [174]. Rosenberg et al. have analyzed the threedimensional structures of Pgp and its conformational change in the presence and absence of nucleotide [175- 177]. The projection of the protein perpendicular to the membrane is roughly rectangular with a maximum depth of 8 nm, a pore size of 2.5 nm and two 3-nm lobes exposed at the cytoplasmic face of the membrane. The conformational change revealed a major reorganization of the TMDs throughout the entire depth of the membrane upon binding of nucleotide (Fig. 2A). In the absence of nucleotide, the two TMDs form a single barrel 5–6 nm in diameter and about 5 nm deep with a central pore that is open to the extracellular surface and spans much of the membrane depth. Upon binding nucleotide, the TMDs reorganize into three compact domains that are each 2–3 nm in diameter and 5–6 nm deep (Fig. 2B). This reorganization opens the central pore along its length in a manner that could allow access of hydrophobic drugs (transport substrates) directly from the lipid bilayer to the central pore of the transporter [176]. When one of two NBDs of Pgp is inactivated, not only drug transport but also ATP hydrolysis of normal NBD is inhibited. This result indicates that two NBDs would function cooperatively and they could not hydrolyze ATP independently [178]. It was recently reported that structural changes of NBDs are brought about when a drug binds to TMD so that the distance between NBDs is changed to affect the activity of ATPase as shown in Fig. 3[179]. Unlike in Pgp, however, the substrate leukotriene C4 could not be transported once NBD2 is inactivated but the substrate transport could not be inhibited when NBD1 is inactivated in MRP1 [180]. This result suggests that among ABC transporters, interactions of NBDs are not simple but function differently for every transport. Although the exact site and number of Pgp binding with drugs have not yet been determined, the important binding sites such as TMD 4, 5, 6, 10, 11 and 12 have been determined [181] whereas substrate drugs do not bind to NBDs [182]. Development of chemosensitizers to overcome resistance One of the causes for the failure of chemotherapy in the treatment of cancer is the emergence of MDR. Once MDR appears, chemotherapy is not effective even when using high doses of drugs enough to overcome resistance, toxic effects are brought about and the resistance mechanism could be further stimulated. These problems could be resolved by the use of the anticancer drugs that could bypass the resistance mechanism. For example, we could use other anticancer drugs such as alkylating drugs (cyclophosphamide), antimetabolites (5-fluorouracil), and the anthracycline modified drugs (annamycin and doxorubicin- peptide) that would not function as the substrates of ABC transporters [183-185]. The final method of overcoming resistance is to administer substances inhibiting ABC transporters with anticancer drugs at the same time. These substances would reverse resistance against anticancer drugs to eventually being sensitized for anticancer drugs so they are called chemosensitizers. They are also called MDR modulators and MDR reverters. Chemosensitizers against each transporter are summarized according to the publishing years (Table 3). Of these, some are chemosensitizers against one transporter and some others against more than two transporters. Many drugs such as the calcium channel blocker verapamil and the immunosuppressant cyclosporin A would inhibit resistance by functioning as competitive substrates of Pgp regardless of their innate pharmacological functions. Different clinical studies also showed that these drugs could reverse resistance to anticancer drugs.

However, verapamil brings about cardiac toxicity at the concentration inhibiting resistance; thus, in order to resolve this problem, the attempts were made to develop (R)-verapmil [187] and verapamil analogues having lower cardiac toxicity compared with (S)- verapamil [188,189]. The immunosuppressant cyclosporin A was first reported to reverse resistance by acute leukemia against vincristine and daunorubicin rapamycin could inhibit MDR [191]. However, when cyclosporin A is applied clinically, researchers placed efforts to develop cyclosporin analogues having few side effects due to their innate immuno suppressant effects and hepatic and renal toxicity with excellent chemosensitizing effects. As a result, PSC-833 (Valspodar), which is the non-immune suppressant analogue of cyclosporin, was developed [110]. In addition to non-immunosuppressant effect, its chemosensitivity is about 10 times higher than that by cyclosporin in Pgp-mediated MDR, so clinical studies are being performed on this drug [192]. Among those drugs having their innate pharmacological activities such as verapamil and cyclosporin A, those having chemosensitizing effect is called the first-generation chemosensitizers. The problems related with the first-generation chemosensitizers are that they generally show low effects and high toxicity at resistance-inhibiting doses. In order to supplement these problems, the chemosensitizers developed only for chemosensitizing effects are called the second- generation chemosensitizers, which include PSC- 833, VX-710, LY335979, XR9051 and XR9576 [193]. Multi-national companies are pursuing the development of second-generation chemosensitizers by overcoming the problems of existing chemosensitizers (low effects, side effects, and drug-drug interaction), and some of these chemosensitizers are in the process of being tested clinically. Most chemosensitizers bind with TMD in transporter, but steroid and flavonoid are new recently introduced chemosensitizers, which inhibit transporters by binding with NBD. The binding site of steroid is different from the binding site of ATP but is probably in the vicinity of the ATP binding site [194]. On the other hand, the flavonoid, kaempferide, is bifunctional in that it would partially block the binding of the antiprogestin RU-486 in the cytoplasm domain of Pgp and block ATP binding [195] (Fig. 4). Recently, flavonoid chemosensitizers reversing Pgpmediated MDR have been screening. It is believed that flavonoid chemosensitizers have a significant advantage with respect with a therapeutic index (Table 4). These may be second-generation flavonoid chemosensitizers [33]. The fungal toxin, fumitremorgin C (FTC), is a strong inhibitor of BCRP but its use in vivo has been limited due to its neurotoxicity [196]. It was recently reported that the tetracyclic analogue of FTC, Ko143, is the most strong chemosensitizer aginst BCRP having little toxicity [140]. Since ABC transporters can be coexpressed in some types of cancer cells, the development of chemosensitizers against MRP and/or BCRP as well as Pgp has been highly demanding. These include VX-710 against Pgp and MRP [82,83], GF120918 against Pgp and BCRP [104,141] and tRA98006 against all three transporters [29]. Conclusion One of the major causes of failure in anticancer chemotherapy is resistance against anticancer drugs. Overexpression of ABC transporters such as Pgp, MRP and BCRP has been shown to be responsible for the major portion of MDR. Therefore elucidation of the structure and the function for each ABC transporter is prerequisite for understanding how these transporters work and for reversing MDR. One strategy for reversal of MDR cells expressing ABC transporters is combined use of anticancer drugs with chemosensitizers. Second-generation chemosensitizers have been developed for the purpose of obtaining higher efficacy and lower toxicity than first-generation chemosensitizers. Inhibitors of ABC transporters can be exploited to enhance the oral bioavailablilty or the brain penetration of various drugs. Combination of a conventional anticancer chemotherapy with new strategies such as chemosensitizers, receptormediated targeting and nanotechnology	Cheol-Hee Choi
12	2003	Multidrug resistance mediated by the breast cancer resistance protein BCRP (ABCG2)	Observations of functional adenosine triphosphate (ATP)- dependent drug efflux in certain multidrug-resistant cancer cell lines without overexpression of P-glycoprotein or multidrug resistance protein (MRP) family members suggested the existence of another ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter capable of causing cancer drug resistance. In one such cell line (MCF-7/AdrVp), the overexpression of a novel member of the G subfamily of ABC transporters was found. The new transporter was termed the breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), because of its identification in MCF-7 human breast carcinoma cells. BCRP is a 655 amino-acid polypeptide, formally designated as ABCG2. Like all members of the ABC G (white) subfamily, BCRP is a half transporter. Transfection and enforced overexpression of BCRP in drug-sensitive MCF-7 or MDA-MB-231 cells recapitulates the drug-resistance phenotype of MCF-7/AdrVp cells, consistent with current evidence suggesting that functional BCRP is a homodimer. BCRP maps to chromosome 4q22, downstream from a TATA-less promoter. The spectrum of anticancer drugs effluxed by BCRP includes mitoxantrone, camptothecin-derived and indolocarbazole topoisomerase I inhibitors, methotrexate, flavopiridol, and quinazoline ErbB1 inhibitors. Transport of anthracyclines is variable and appears to depend on the presence of a BCRP mutation at codon 482. Potent and specific inhibitors of BCRP are now being developed, opening the door to clinical applications of BCRP inhibition. Owing to tissue localization in the placenta, bile canaliculi, colon, small bowel, and brain microvessel endothelium, BCRP may play a role in protecting the organism from potentially harmful xenobiotics. BCRP expression has also been demonstrated in pluripotential ‘side population’ stem cells, responsible for the characteristic ability of these cells to exclude Hoechst 33342 dye, and possibly for the maintenance of the stem cell phenotype. Studies are emerging on the role of BCRP expression in drug resistance in clinical cancers. More prospective studies are needed, preferably combining BCRP protein or mRNA quantification with functional assays, in order to determine the contribution of BCRP to drug resistance in human cancers. Oncogene (2003) 22, 7340–7358. doi:10.1038/sj.onc.1206938 Keywords: cancer; drug resistance; ABC transporter; BCRP; ABCG2 Multidrug resistance (MDR) in cancer cells is the simultaneous development of resistance to a variety of anticancer drugs that appear to be structurally and mechanistically unrelated. One type of MDR is characterized by the decreased accumulation of hydrophobic natural product drugs. In some multidrug-resistant cells, drug efflux is mediated by an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent membrane transporter termed P-glycoprotein (Pgp), the product of the MDR1 gene (Juliano and Ling, 1976). Pgp functions as an active outward transport mechanism for a variety of molecules, including certain chemotherapeutic drugs. As data accumulated regarding the role of Pgp in drug resistance, it became clear that other transporters could confer resistance to cytotoxic agents. The MDR protein 1 (MRP1) gene was cloned from a multidrug-resistant lung cancer cell line and, like Pgp, was found to be a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily of transporter genes (Cole et al., 1992). Transfection studies indicated that, similar to MDR1, MRP1 overexpression is sufficient to confer resistance to a broad profile of lipophilic, natural product antineoplastics. MRP1 was the first identified member of a family of genes encoding multispecific organic anion transporter (MOAT) proteins (Borst et al., 1999). Two other homologues of MRP1, the cMOAT/MRP2 and MRP3 genes encode proteins that mediate MDR when transfected into drug-sensitive cell (Borst et al., 1999). All of these membrane-embedded proteins act as drug efflux pumps, preventing cytotoxic agents from reaching lethal levels within cells. A number of cell lines selected for resistance to the anthracenedione mitoxantrone were discovered to have a transporter activity without overexpression of MDR1 or MRP1 (Dietel et al., 1990; Taylor et al., 1991; Nakagawa et al., 1992; Futscher et al., 1994; Hazlehurst et al., 1999). These cell lines were highly resistant  to mitoxantrone, with cross resistance to doxorubicin and daunorubicin, but were not resistant to vinblastine. The mitoxantrone-resistant breast cancer cell line MCF-7/MX was demonstrated to have markedly decreased accumulation of radiolabeled mitoxantrone, which was not reversed by verapamil (Nakagawa et al., 1992). The enhanced efflux of mitoxantrone in these cells was blocked by sodium azide or 2,4-dinitrophenol, suggesting an ATP-dependent transporter activity. The MCF-7/MX cell line was also found to be highly resistant to the camptothecin analogs topotecan, 9- aminocamptothecin, CPT-11 and SN-38, but was only mildly crossresistant to the parent compound camptothecin (Nakagawa et al., 1992). A pattern of MDR similar to that found with mitoxantrone selection was found in another breast cancer subline made resistant to doxorubicin in the presence of the Pgp inhibitor verapamil (Chen et al., 1990). The resulting doxorubicin-resistant subline, MCF-7/AdrVp, did not overexpress Pgp or MRP1 and exhibited a cross resistance pattern of high resistance to daunorubicin, mitoxantrone, rubidazone, VM-26, and melphalan, but only minimal resistance to vinca alkaloids, actinomycin D, cisplatinum, or paclitaxel. The relative resistance of the MCF-7/AdrVp subline to mitoxantrone was strikingly higher than the resistance to the selecting agent doxorubicin (Lee et al., 1997). The MCF-7/AdrVp subline did not display the altered subcellular distribution of drug seen in many cell lines that express MRP1 (Lee et al., 1997). Decreased accumulation of daunorubicin and the fluorescent dye rhodamine 123 throughout the cytoplasm was seen in MCF-7/AdrVp cells (Doyle et al., 1995; Lee et al., 1997). Although this decreased accumulation was not reversed by cyclosporin A, depletion of ATP resulted in complete abrogation of the enhanced efflux of both daunorubicin and rhodamine (Lee et al., 1997). These findings led to the hypothesis that an ATP-dependent xenobiotic transporter contributed to the MDR phenotype of MCF-7/AdrVp cells. Identification of the BCRP gene Our laboratory was able to identify a novel ABC transporter in MCF-7/AdrVp cells, and to demonstrate that the enforced expression of the transporter in drugsensitive MCF-7 cells recapitulated the drug-resistant phenotype of the MCF-7/AdrVp cells (Doyle et al., 1998). We named the new transporter breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), because it was derived from a resistant breast cancer cell line. To isolate BCRP, we examined RNA transcripts overexpressed in the MCF-  may allow noninvasive monitoring of chemotherapy and MDR gene therapy agents. Chen et al. (2000) investigated the transport of 99mTc-tetrofosmin, a candidate radiopharmaceutical substrate of ABC transporters in cells overexpressing BCRP. Neither 99mTc- Sestimibi, a previously validated MDR imaging agent, nor 99mTc-Tetrofosmin was a substrate for BCRP, although both agents were transported by cells overexpressing Pgp. ATP-dependent efflux of active phosphorylated metabolites of zidovudine (AZT) in a BCRP-overexpressing human CD4þ T-cell line (MT-4) was recently described. The activity of AZT and lamivudine against HIV-1 viral replication in these BCRP-overexpressing T cells was considerably reduced compared to parental MT-4 cells (Wang et al., 2003). BCRP substrates and inhibitors are summarized in Table 2. Gene therapy approaches to modulating BCRP Modulation of the BCRP multidrug-resistant phenotype by a hammerhead ribozyme directed against the transporter has recently been reported (Kowalski et al., 20 Idarubicinola Estradiol 17-b?

High expression was also seen in the liver and small intestine. Interestingly, certain areas of the brain (particularly the midbrain: putamen, substantia nigra, pituitary gland, thalamus, amygdala, caudate, and subthalamic nuclei) had relatively high expression of BCRP mRNA. In contrast to our earlier Northern blot studies, the dot blots showed moderate expression of BCRP in lung tissue, and low expression in testis, ovary, and colon. Immunohistochemical studies with BXP-21 demonstrated moderate to strong BCRP expression in placenta, liver canaliculi, colon, small intestine, cardiac muscle, endocrine pancreas, adrenal cortex, thyroid, and parathyroid (Izquierdo et al., 2002). A weaker expression of BCRP was observed in other tissues such as hypophysis, prostate, bronchial epithelium, and peribronchial glands. In the kidneys, glomeruli were negative but faint BCRP expression was detected in certain tubules. While mouse kidney expresses high levels of BCRP expression by immunohistochemistry, human kidney does not (Schuetz et al., 2002). Normal tissues without detectable BCRP expression included endometrial cells and squamous epithelial cells in the skin or esophagus. BCRP is variably expressed by immunohistochemistry in normal breast epithelium and blood vessels (Faneyte et al., 2002). Low or undetectable BCRP expression in human and murine lung were also observed by immunohistochemical studies (Scheffer et al., 2002). The expression of BCRP in normal tissues as detected by immunohistochemistry is summarized in Table 3. Immunohistochemical studies of the placenta, using the monoclonal antibody BXP-34, suggest that BCRP expression is highest in the placental syncytiotrophoblast, at the apical surface of the chorionic villus (Maliepaard et al., 2001a). This localization suggests that BCRP plays a protective role for the fetus by effluxing drugs that enter the placenta back into the maternal circulation. Evidence for this hypothesis was provided by Jonker et al. (2000), who demonstrated that in pregnant, Pgp-deficient mice, fetal penetration of topotecan is increased at least twofold by the BCRP inhibitor GF120918. A recent review of efflux transporters in the human placenta is available (Young et al., 2003). BCRP may also be an important component of the blood–brain barrier, excluding xenobiotics from the brain. The porcine homologue of BCRP was found in cultured brain capillary endothelial cells, which have high transendothelial electrical resistances and low cell monolayer permeabilities for small solutes very similar to the blood–brain barrier (Eisenblatter and Galla, 2002). Further analysis revealed that the porcine BCRP was expressed in brain tissue in vivo and was predominantly localized within the endothelial cells isolated from brain capillaries. The presence of BCRP in the luminal surface of the endothelium of human brain microvessels was recently demonstrated by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy (Cooray et al., 2002). This suggests that BCRP, like Pgp and MRP1, contributes to the blood–brain barrier. The expression of porcine BCRP was induced in brain capillary endothelial cells by hydrocortisone (Eisenblatter and Galla, 2002), suggesting that this steroid may be a substrate for the transporter. Estrone and 17b-estradiol have been found to potentiate the cytotoxicity of SN-38, mitoxantrone, and topotecan in BCRP-transfected cells but not in a parental K562 line (Imai et al., 2002b). Estrone and 17b-estradiol also increased the cellular accumulation of topotecan in K562/BCRP cells. Since BCRP is expressed in the placenta, where these steroid hormones are produced, these findings suggest that BCRP may be important in the transport or secretion of these hormones or their precursors in the placenta. BCRP effects on drug bioavailability, pharmacokinetics Strong staining for BCRP was observed at the apical membrane of the small intestine and colon epithelium and in the bile canalicular membrane (Jonker et al., 2000). In fact, BCRP and MRP2 transcripts measured by quantitative PCR were more abundant in jejunum biopsies from healthy volunteers than were MDR1 transcripts (Taipalensuu et al., 2001). The apical localization of BCRP in gut tissue suggests a role of BCRP in reducing the uptake of orally administered BCRP substrates. In mice, Bcrp1 mediates apically directed transport of topotecan in the polarized kidney epithelial cell line LLC-PK1 (Jonker et al., 2000). The oral availability of topotecan is dramatically increased by oral coadministration of the Bcrp1 inhibitor GF120918 in both Pgp-deficient and wild-type mice. The plasma clearance and hepatobiliary excretion of topotecan were also decreased by GF120918. These findings suggest that BCRP plays an important role in the intestine and liver, limiting the oral availability of BCRP substrates by active backtransport of these molecules entering from the gut lumen. The role of transporters including BCRP in hepatobiliary transport is discussed in a recent review (Elferink and Groen, 2002). Coadministration of GF120918 also resulted in a significant increase in the systemic exposure of oral  cytotoxic drugs in combination with inhibitors of Pgp, but these patients may also be at particular risk to develop non-Pgp mechanisms of MDR. List et al. (1999) used cyclosporine in combination with daunorubicin in patients with AML. They found that Pgp-positive leukemic blasts were eliminated and that patients relapsed with a non-Pgp mechanism of drug resistance. We have examined blast cells from 21 acute leukemia patients (one acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 20 AML) for BCRP expression with quantitative RT–PCR (Ross et al., 2000). Blast cells in seven patients with clinical drug-resistant disease had relatively high expression of BCRP mRNA. BCRP expression was low or barely detectable in blast cells from the remaining 14 patients. Expression of BCRP did not correlate with the expression of Pgp. However, other studies have demonstrated that high expression of BCRP correlated with an Table 4 BCRP Expression in human leukemias Disease type Number studied Methods Findings Reference AML, ALL 20 AML, one ALL.

These studies did not evaluate for mutations of the BCRP expressed at codon 482, the ‘mutational hot-spot’ found in drug-selected cells (Honjo et al., 2001a). In studies of blast cells from acute leukemia patients at the University of Maryland, we were able to correlate high expression of BCRP with in vitro resistance of the blast cells to flavopiridol (Nakanishi et al., 2003). In the region of BCRP mRNA corresponding to codon 482, all of the blast cell samples tested expressed the wild-type sequence. A study of 47 initial stage and 20 relapsed children with ALL indicated low expression of BCRP, particularly in T-lineage ALL, and no prognostic significance of BCRP expression was observed (Sauerbrey et al., 2002). In contrast, this same group found that in childhood AML, BCRP expression was associated with a poor response to remission induction therapy (Steinbach et al., 2002). The prognostic significance of BCRP and other transporters in leukemias is the subject of some recent review papers (Ross, 2000; van den Heuvel-Eibrink et al., 2000; van der Kolk et al., 2002a). Solid tumor studies (summarized in Table 5) Initial immunohistochemical studies with monoclonal antibody BXP-34 using a panel of human tumors showed BCRP to be low or undetectable except for one case of small intestine adenocarcinoma (Scheffer et al., 2000). However, subsequent investigation by the same investigators, using a second monoclonal antibody, BXP-21, in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens, demonstrated BCRP immunoreactivity in over 40% of solid tumors tested (Diestra et al., 2002). These studies included 150 tumors from 21 different types of untreated cancer, and demonstrated weak to extremely strong BCRP immunoreactivity in some examples of most tumor types tested. BCRP reactivity was absent or low in bladder cancer, ovarian cancer, and small-cell carcinomas, but was detected in colon cancers, esophageal cancers, endometrial cancers The expression of BCRP in lung tumors was confirmed by Kawabata et al. (2001a), who used RT–PCR to detect low levels of BCRP in four of 12 lung cancer cell lines and approximately one-half of 44 lung tumor tissues tested. Topotecan efflux in the lung cancer cell lines correlated with the levels of BCRP mRNA expressed. The expression of BCRP in venules, as detected by immunohistochemistry, suggests that low levels of BCRP detected in tissue biopsies by PCR-based techniques must be interpreted with caution. Ironically, despite its original isolation from multidrug- resistant human breast cancer cells, the level of BCRP expression in clinical breast cancer cases appears low by RT–PCR (Kanzaki et al., 2001). Immunohistochemical studies confirmed undetectable expression of BCRP in breast tumors, even in biopsies from women relapsing after doxorubicin-based chemotherapy (Faneyte et al., 2002). Reviews of the role of BCRP in drug resistance of clinical cancers are available (Bates et al., 2001; Litman et al., 2001; Ejendal and Hrycyna, 2002). Unanswered questions and pending studies Current investigations of the BCRP transporter are in progress using models developed to characterize Pgp and MRP family members. The potential role for homodimerization and heterodimerization of the BCRP half-transporter adds a level of complexity of the studies required and limits the firmness of conclusions drawn about BCRP function. Conclusions regarding the substrate specificity of BCRP transport may also be limited by a lack of understanding of other necessary cofactors for transport. The physiologic function of BCRP is incompletely understood, although the localization of the protein to the placenta, lining cells of the intestine, and small blood vessels is suggestive for some normal functions of the protein. The expression of BCRP in the pluripotent SP stem cells from many tissues may allow the transporter to be used as a marker to define and characterize these interesting cells. Transplant studies with Bcrp1-transduced bone marrow cells are ongoing and suggest that expression of Bcrp1 may have important functional effects in the stem cell compartment. The spectrum of drugs transported by BCRP and/or inhibiting BCRP function is evolving rapidly. The inhibition of BCRP by the tyrosine kinase inhibitors CI1033 and Iressa, for example, suggests the possibility that other clinically important quinazoline drugs may also be substrates and/or inhibitors of BCRP. Another way of revising BCRP-mediated resistance is to cleave the protein specifically using hammerhead ribozymes. A specific high-activity ribozyme directed at BCRP has recently been developed and found to cleave BCRP mRNA efficiently in a cell-free system (Kowalski et al., 2001, 2002). The role of BCRP in clinical cancer resistance is currently under investigation, now that immunologic and other molecular probes have become available. Furthermore, the sequence at codon 482 should be investigated, particularly in studies relating the clinical response to anthracyclines or methotrexate with BCRP expression. BCRP may have a role in recurrent tumors, especially in hematologic malignancies in which patients have been treated with chemotherapy concurrent with inhibitors of Pgp. Ribozyme-based gene therapy may become clinically applicable in preventing or reversing BCRP-mediated drug resistance (van der Kolk et al., 2002b). Furthermore, inhibition of the BCRP transporter present at various tissue barriers may suggest ways to alter the pharmacokinetics of certain drugs. The oral coadministration of BCRP inhibitors could improve the intestinal availability of BCRP-substrate drugs such as topotecan and irinotecan. The use of new antibody probes, specific pharmacologic inhibitors, and animal models of BCRP function should allow rapid development of understanding of the physiologic and pathologic role of this interesting transporter.

13	2019	Different Efflux Transporter Aff inity and Metabolism of 99mTc-2-Methoxyisobutylisonitrile and 99mTc-Tetrofosmin for Multidrug Resistance Monitoring in Cancer	ABSTRACT Background Little is known about the affinity and stability of 99mTc-labeled 2-methoxyisobutylisonitrile (99mTc-MIBI) and tetrofosmin (99mTc-TF) for imaging of multiple drug resistance transporters in cancer. We examined the affinity of 99mTc-labeled compounds for these transporters and their stability. Methods 99mTc-MIBI and 99mTc-TF were incubated in vesicles expressing P-glycoprotein (MDR1), multidrug resistanceassociated protein (MRP)1–4, or breast cancer resistance protein with and without verapamil (MDR1 inhibitor) or MK- 571 (MRP inhibitor). Time activity curves of 99mTc-labeled compounds were established using SK-N-SH neuroblastoma, SK-MEL-28 melanoma, and PC-3 prostate adenocarcinoma cell lines, and transporter expression of multiple drug resistance was measured in these cells. The stability was evaluated. Results In vesicles, 99mTc-labeled compounds had affinity for MDR1 and MRP1. 99mTc-TF had additional affinity for MRP2 and MRP3. In SK-N-SH cells expressing MDR1 and MRP1, MK-571 produced the highest uptake of both 99mTclabeled compounds. 99mTc-MIBI uptake with inhibitors was higher than 99mTc-TF uptake with inhibitors. 99mTc-TF was taken up more in SK-MEL-28 cells expressing MRP1 and MRP2 than PC-3 cells expressing MRP1 and MRP3. 99mTc- MIBI was metabolized, whereas 99mTc-TF had high stability. Conclusion 99mTc-MIBI is exported via MDR1 and MRP1 (MRP1 > MDR1) at greater levels and more quickly compared to 99mTc-TF, which is exported via MDR1 and MRP1–3 (MRP1 > MDR1; MRP1, 2 >MRP3). Because 99mTc-MIBI is metabolized, clinical imaging for monitoring MDR and shorter examination times may be possible with an earlier scanning time on late phase imaging. 99mTc-TF has high stability and accurately reflects the function of MDR1 and MRP1–3. INTRODUCTION Multiple drug resistance (MDR) in cancer is often associated with an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent decrease in cellular drug accumulation and is attributed to the overexpression of certain ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter proteins. ABC transporters belong to the largest transporter gene family and generally use energy derived from ATP hydrolysis for translocation of different substrates across biological membranes. ABC transporters are classified into seven subfamilies based on phylogenetic analysis and are designated ABCA to ABCG (1). In tumor cell lines, ABC proteins mainly include P-glycoprotein (MDR1) (gene symbol ABCB1), the multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1, gene symbol ABCC1), MRP2 (gene symbol ABCC2), MRP3 (gene symbol ABCC3), MRP4 (gene symbol ABCC4), and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP, gene symbol ABCG2). 99mTc-labeled 2-methoxyisobutylisonitrile (99mTc-MIBI) and 99mTc-labeled tetrofosmin (99mTc-TF) are lipophilic monocationic radiotracers that are widely used for myocardial perfusion imaging (2) and tumor imaging (3) in single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) studies. In tumor imaging, MDR to anticancer drugs has been estimated using both 99mTc-labeled compounds in clinical studies (4,5). ABC transporters, which are associated withMDR, are often highly expressed in cancer cells. 99mTc-labeled compounds are mainly exported viaMDR1 (6–8) andMRP1 (7). Many ABC transporters, not only MDR1 andMRP1 but also MRP2–4 (9–11) and BCRP (12), are expressed in cancer cells. However, whether MRP2–4 and BCRP are associated with export of 99mTc-labeled compounds has not been clearly determined. If 99mTc-labeled compounds are metabolized completely and immediately after injection in vivo, monitoring of MDR in cancers may be affected in clinical SPECT imaging because metabolites of 99mTc-labeled compoundsmay not be taken up in cancers and undergo efflux through MDR when clinical imaging is performed in the early phase (10–30 min) and the late phase (2–3 h) after injection (4,5). However, the stability of 99mTc-labeled compounds has not been sufficiently evaluated in vivo. We examinedwhether 99mTc-labeled compounds were exported via MRP2–4 and BCRP and whether these compounds had affinity for these transporters including MDR1 and MRP1 in cancer cells. Furthermore, stability of the 99mTc-labeled compounds over time was investigated in a human-derived cancer cell line, mouse liver, and human liver, which is an important organ for metabolism. MATERIALS AND METHODS Materials 99mTc-MIBI (300 MBq/mL) and 99mTc-TF (592 MBq/mL) injection kits were purchased from FUJIFILM RI Pharma Co., Ltd. (Chiba, Japan) and Nihon Medi-physics Co., Ltd. (Chiba, Japan), respectively. 99mTcO4 − was eluted from a 99Mo/99mTccolumn generators (Nihon Medi-physics Co., Ltd., Chiba, Japan). β-nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate (β- NADP+) and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase were purchased from Oriental Yeast (Osaka, Japan). Verapamil hydrate and MK-571 sodium salt were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA) and Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI, USA), respectively. Human liver S9 was purchased from Corning Gentest (New York, NY, USA). Vesicles We used ABC transporter vesicles (GenoMembrane Inc., Kanagawa, Japan) transfected with human MDR1, MRP1– 4, and BCRP. Experimental kits were also purchased from GenoMembrane Inc. and were used for experiments with each ABC transporter. Vesicle Assay After pre-incubation of vesicles for 10 min, 37 kBq 99mTclabeled compound was incubated for 5 min with each vesicle solution and ATP, which supplies energy for ABC transporters, or adenosine monophosphate (AMP), which does not provide energy and was used for comparison to ATP, on nitrocellulose filters, and the radioactivity was measured using a γ-ray counter (AccuFLEXγ7000, Aloka, Tokyo, Japan) (13). Uptake of 99mTc-MIBI or 99mTc-TF in ATP solution was compared with that in AMP solution. When uptake of 99mTc-MIBI or 99mTc- TF in ATP solution was higher than that in AMP solution, this indicated an effect on ABC transporters for 99mTc-MIBI or 99mTc-TF. In assays with inhibitors, uptake of 99mTc-MIBI or 99mTc-TF was examined in ATP solution with verapamil, a MDR1 inhibitor, or MK-571, a MRP inhibitor. Cancer Cells The following cultured human cancer cell lines were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA): SK-N-SH neuroblastoma, SK-MEL-28 melanoma, and PC-3 prostate adenocarcinoma. Cancer cells were incubated in αMEM (Wako, Osaka, Japan; SK-N-SH cells) or Dulbecco’sModifiedEagle’sMedium (Wako; SK-MEL-28 cells) or RPMI-1640 Medium (Sigma; PC-3 cells) with 10% fetal bovine serum. Expression of ABC Transporters in Human Cancer Cells Expression of ABC transporters in human cancer cells was evaluated as described (14). The following genes were analyzed using real-time polymerase chain reaction with a Mx3005P thermocycler (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA): MDR1 (ABCB1) andMRP1, 2, 3 (ABCC1, 2, and 3) as summarized in Table I. Three different housekeeping genes, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), beta actin (ACTB), and hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase-1 (HPRT1), were amplified to control for the differences between the initial RNA and cDNA amounts. Cancer Cells The following cultured human cancer cell lines were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA): SK-N-SH neuroblastoma, SK-MEL-28 melanoma, and PC-3 prostate adenocarcinoma.

Three different housekeeping genes, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), beta actin (ACTB), and hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase-1 (HPRT1), were amplified to control for the differences between the initial RNA and cDNA amounts. Time activity curves of 99mTc-TF with MK-571 loading in SK-MEL-28 cells showed the highest uptake (Fig. 3b). Whole-body images of SK-N-SH-bearing mice were obtained for 99mTc-MIBI (Fig. 4a) and 99mTc-TF (Fig. 4b) at 5– 10 min (c, f), 30–35 min (d, g), and 55–60 min (e, h). The accumulation between brain and lung was in brown adipocytes around the neck. Accumulation in SK-N-SH cells was lower than in abdominal organs at all acquisition times. Although we observed similar accumulation levels in SK-NSH cells between 99mTc-MIBI (Fig. 4Ac) and 99mTc-TF (Fig. 4Bf) at 5–10 min after injection, accumulation of 99mTc-MIBI in liver was lower than that of 99mTc-TF. At 30–35 min, we observed that the accumulation of 99mTc-MIBI in SK-N-SH cells was lower than that of 99mTc-TF. Background levels of 99mTc-MIBI were also lower than those of 99mTc-TF. The whole-body distributions of 99mTc-MIBI (Fig. 5a) and 99mTc-TF (Fig. 5b) were obtained from whole-body images. Accumulation in the gallbladder was higher than that in other organs, and excretion via the kidneys was fast. In liver, 99mTc- TF had higher accumulation than 99mTc-MIBI at 10 min after injection as shown in Fig. 4. In the parathyroid and heart, these accumulations did not change much over time, but 99mTc-MIBI accumulated more than 99mTc-TF. Time activity curves of SK-N-SH cells (Fig. 6) fromwholebody images in Fig. 4 showed that more 99mTc-MIBI underwent significant efflux from the tumors than 99mTc-TF during the first 50 min after injection. 99mTc-MIBI underwent rapid efflux from the tumors until about 30 min after injection, and then showed moderate efflux, whereas 99mTc-TF underwent gradual efflux from the tumors over time (Fig. 6a). Regarding accumulation in SK-N-SH cells of 99mTc- MIBI (Fig. 6b) and 99mTc-TF (Fig. 6c) with verapamil or MK-571 loading, MK-571 loading yielded higher accumulation with the two 99mTc-labeled compounds because MRP in SK-N-SH cells was inhibited by MK-571. In the time activity curves of 99mTc-MIBI (Fig. 6b), both inhibitors provided significantly higher accumulation than the control condition at about 30 min after injection. In the time activity curves of 99mTc-TF (Fig. 6c), verapamil loading led to an increase in accumulation at about 10 min, whereas MK-571 loading led to an increase in accumulation at about 50 min. Regarding the stability over time for both 99mTc-labeled compounds in SK-N-SH cells, mouse liver, plasma, and human liver S9 fractions (Table II), the Rf values of 99mTc-MIBI, 99mTc-TF, and 99mTcO4 − were in the ranges of 0.15–0.25, 0.20–0.30, and 0.85–0.95 in our study, respectively. Although both 99mTc-labeled compounds were slightly metabolized up to 20 min after injection in all tissues, the radiochemical fraction of 99mTc-MIBI shifted from 97.5 ± 3.2% to 32.4 ± 17.5%, 26.3 ± 14.2%, 79.9 ± 18.5%, and 62.9 ± 12.1% in SK-N-SH cells, mouse liver, human liver S9 fractions, and show that 99mTc-TF is also transported by MRP2 and MRP3. To confirm the mechanism and the affinity of efflux of 99mTc-labeled compounds via the ABC transporters in human cancer cells, we selected SK-N-SH cells, which express MDR1 and MRP1, as model cancer cells that highly express ABC transporters. In the assay (Fig. 2), because uptake of 99mTc-labeled compounds was significantly increased by verapamil and MK-571 inhibitors, the efflux mechanism of 99mTc-labeled compounds could be identified as involving MDR1 and MRP1. The time activity curves of both 99mTclabeled compounds andMK-571 loading showed significantly higher uptake than in the control condition or with verapamil loading, although MDR1 and MRP1 are expressed at similarly high levels in SK-N-SH cells. Thus, when MDR1 and MRP1 are highly expressed in cancers, 99mTc-labeled compounds will be exported via MDR1 and MRP1, but MRP1 is more sensitive than MDR1. Time activity curves of 99mTc- MIBI with each inhibitor showed higher uptake than that of 99mTc-TF with each inhibitor. Therefore, 99mTc-MIBI is exported via MDR1 and MRP1 (MDR1 <MRP1) at greater levels and more quickly than 99mTc-TF, and this is important forMDR monitoring. Although Gomes et al. have also reported that 99mTc-MIBI is more sensitive to MRP1 than 99mTc- TF in vitro (8), they evaluated the relationship between 99mTclabeled compounds and efflux transporters using a small-cell lung cancer cell line with single overexpression of MDR1 or MRP1. Because cancer cells usually overexpress multiple transporters, e.g., MDR1 and/or MRP1–3, our results strongly certified that 99mTc-MIBI is more sensitive to MRP1 than 99mTc-TF using cancer cells that overexpress both MDR1 and MRP1. Time activity curves of 99mTc-MIBI with MK-571 loading showed very little difference in accumulation in SK-MEL-28 and PC-3 cells (Fig. 3a). Regarding MDR expression in PC-3 and SK-MEL-28 cells (Table I), although little MDR1 expression was seen in either cell line, MRP1 expression in PC-3 cells was higher than that in SK-MEL-28 cells. When expression of MRP1 is somewhat high in cancer cells, time activity curves of 99mTc-MIBI,which is exported viaMDR1 andMRP1,may be similar. In the time activity curves of 99mTc-TF (Fig. 3b), 99mTc- TF with MK-571 loading in SK-MEL-28 cells, which express MRP1 and MRP2, showed higher accumulation than that in PC-3 cells, which express MRP1 and MRP3. Although 99mTc- TF was exported by not only MDR1 and MRP1 but also MRP2 and MRP3, MRP3 may have a smaller effect than MRP1 and MRP2 in export of 99mTc-TF. In whole-body imaging of a SK-N-SH-bearing mouse injected with 99mTc-MIBI (Fig. 4a) or 99mTc-TF (Fig. 4b) at 5– 10 min (c, f), 30–35 min (d, g), and 55–60 min (e, h), accumulation in SK-N-SH cells was lower than in abdominal organs at all acquisition times. Although we observed similar accumulation levels between 99mTc-MIBI (Fig. 4Ac) and 99mTc-TF (Fig. 4Bf) at 5–10 min after injection in SK-N-SH cells, accumulation of 99mTc-MIBI in liver was lower than that of 99mTc-TF. Liver mainly expressesMDR1, MRP2, BCRP, and the bile salt export pump, which are ABC transporters that are the same types of MDR efflux transporters expressed in tumor cells. We suggest that 99mTc-MIBI is transferred quickly from liver to gallbladder after injection. At 30–35 min after injection, the accumulation of 99mTc-MIBI (Fig. 4Ad) was likely lower than that of 99mTc-TF (Fig. 4Bg) in SK-N-SH cells, and background levels of 99mTc- MIBI were also lower than those of 99mTc-TF because excretion of 99mTc-MIBI was faster than that of 99mTc-TF (Fig. 5). The whole-body distribution of 99mTc-MIBI (Fig. 5a) and 99mTc-TF (Fig. 5b) was obtained from whole-body images. Because liver and kidney express MDR1 but not MRP1 for efflux and excretion of both 99mTc-labeled compounds (20), 99mTc-MIBI showed faster transport to the gallbladder and quicker excretion via MDR1 than 99mTc-TF. Therefore, we found that 99mTc-MIBI is sensitive to the ABC transporter, MDR1, in whole-body imaging. In the parathyroid and heart, accumulation did not change much over time, but 99mTc-MIBI accumulation than the control condition at about 30min (Fig. 6B). The results of our in vivo study emphasized that export of 99mTc- MIBI is more sensitive to MRP1 than MDR1, and the metabolites of 99mTc-MIBI will be minimally exported viaMDR1 and MRP1.On the other hand, 99mTc-TF underwent gradual efflux from the tumors via MDR1 and MRP1 in SK-N-SH cells over time (Fig. 4A) because we estimate that 99mTc-TF was much more stable at all scanning times. In the time activity curves of 99mTc-TF (Fig. 6C), verapamil and MK-571 loading increased the accumulation compared to the control condition at 10 min and 50 min, respectively. This result shows that export of 99mTc-TF is also more sensitive to MRP1 than MDR1. However, the effect of both inhibitors was smaller than the effect on 99mTc-MIBI because involvement of 99mTc-TF with MDR1 and MRP1–3 may be smaller than that of 99mTc-MIBI. In clinical settings, MDR in solid cancers has been evaluated by comparing washout rates between the early time phase (10–30 min) and the late time phase (2–3 h) after injection of 99mTc-labeled compounds (4,5). If 99mTc-labeled compounds are metabolized in cancers and the liver completely and immediately after injection, monitoring of MDR in cancers may be affected because metabolites of 99mTc-labeled compounds may not be taken up in cancers and undergo efflux through MDR1 and MRP. In our study, 99mTc-MIBI was metabolized about 32%, 26%, and 80% in SK-N-SH cells, mouse liver, and human liver S9 at 30 min and about 36%, 36%, and 85% at 60 min after injection (Table II), respectively. Perek and Le Jeune evaluated monoglutathionyl conjugation in glioma cells with high levels of glutathione for drug metabolism using both 99mTc compounds (22,23). They showed that 99mTc-MIBI was metabolized to about 90% at 30 min, whereas 99mTc-TF was metabolized to about 20% at 30 min. The amounts of metabolites of 99mTc-MIBI were similar to those of human liver S9, but higher than in SK-NSH cells because SK-N-SH cells may have less drug metabolizing enzyme including glutathione S-transferase than glioma cells (23). On the other hand, little metabolism of 99mTc-TF occurs in all tissues. These results were different from Jeune’s results because 99mTc-TF may not be susceptible to metabolism by glutathione S-transferase in mice, human liver, and SK-N-SH cells. Additionally, mouse and human liver may have lower expression levels of glutathione Stransferase than glioma cells. Therefore, metabolites of 99mTc-TF may not have been present in our study. However, the influence of these metabolites will be small because 99mTc-MIBI shows MDR in the early time phase before metabolism of 99mTc-MIBI occurs (Fig. 4a). On the other hand, 99mTc-TF imaging showed accurate MDR using two scans in the early time phase and late time phase because 99mTc-TF is stable (Table II). CONCLUSION The efflux mechanism and metabolism of 99mTc-labeled compounds differed in human cancer cells and SK-N-SH-bearing mice.When cancers expressMDR1 and MRP1, 99mTc-MIBI is exported via MDR1 and MRP1 (MRP1 > MDR1) at greater levels and more quickly compared to 99mTc-TF. 99mTc-TF is exported by not only MDR1 and MRP1 but also MRP2 and MRP3, althoughMRP3 has a smaller influence thanMRP1 and MRP2 (MRP1 > MDR1; MRP1, 2 > MRP3). Because 99mTc-MIBI is metabolized in human-derived cancers and human liver S9 fractions, clinical imaging to monitor MDR1 and MRP1 will be possible, and shorter SPECT examination times may be possible by switching to an earlier scan time (0.5–1 h etc.) for late phase imaging at 2–3 h after injection. 99mTc-TF has high stability and reflects the function of MDR1 and MRP1–3.

14	1989	Expression of a Multidrug Resistance Gene in Human Cancers	Many cancers have been cured by chemotherapeutic agents. However, other cancers are intrinsically drug resistant, and some acquire resistance following chemotherapy. Cloning of the cDNA for the human MDR1 gene (also known as PGY1), which encodes the multidrug efflux protein P-glycoprotein, has made it possible to measure levels of MDR1 RNA in human cancers. We report the levels of MDR1 RNA in >400 human cancers. MDR1 RNA levels were usually elevated in untreated, intrinsically drug-resistant tumors, including those derived from the colon, kidney, adrenal gland, liver, and pancreas, as well as in carcinoid tumors, chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast crisis, and cell lines of non-small cell carcinoma of the lung (NSCLC) with neuroendocrine properties. MDR1 RNA levels were occasionally elevated in other untreated cancers, including neuroblastoma, acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) in adults, acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) in adults, and indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. MDR1 RNA levels were also increased in some cancers at relapse after chemotherapy, including ALL, ANLL, breast cancer, neuroblastoma, pheochromocytoma, and nodular, poorly differentiated lymphoma. Many types of drug-sensitive and drug-resistant tumors, including NSCLC and melanoma, contained undetectable or low levels of MDR1 RNA. The consistent association of MDR1 expression with several intrinsically resistant cancers and the increased expression of the MDR1 gene in certain cancers with acquired drug resistance indicate that the MDR1 gene contributes to multidrug resistance in many human cancers. Thus, evaluation of MDR1 gene expression may prove to be a valuable tool in the identification of individuals whose cancers are resistant to specific agents. The information may be useful in designing or altering chemotherapeutic protocols in these patients. [J Nat! Cancer Inst 1989;81:116-124] Chemotherapeutic agents have proven to be effective in the cure or palliation of some human cancers; however, both intrinsic drug resistance and acquired drug resistance remain clinical obstacles in the treatment of many other cancers. For the study of the mechanisms of multidrug resistance, tumor cell lines have been selected for resistance to the Vinca alkaloids, doxorubicin, dactinomycin, and related natural products (1-5). Intracellular drug accumulation has been found to be decreased secondary to increased drug efflux in these cell lines (2,6). These multidrug-resistant cell lines usually contain an amplified gene, termed MDR1 (also known as PGY1) in the human, that is transcribed into a 4.5-kilobase mRNA (7-12). The protein product of this gene is a 170-kilodalton membrane glycoprotein, called P-glycoprotein or the multidrug transporter, which is an energy-dependent drug efflux pump (13,14). A full-length cDNA for the MDR1 gene from one of the multidrug-resistant human KB carcinoma cell lines has been isolated and sequenced (15,16). With the use of a region of this cDNA as a probe, the MDR1 gene has been shown to be expressed at a high level in normal human kidney, adrenal gland, liver, and colon (17). In the kidney, liver, and colon, the MDR1 gene product (P-glycoprotein) was present on the luminal surface of epithelial cells, which is consistent with a normal role of this protein as a transporter (18). In addition, several human cancers, including adenocarcinomas derived from tissues that normally express the MDR1 gene, have been shown to overexpress MDR1 RNA (17,19). Immunochemical analysis revealed overexpression of P-glycoprotein in two of five patients with ovarian carcinoma (20) and in two patients with drug-resistant acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) (21). In 25 patients with sarcoma, six tumor samples had elevated levels of P-glycoprotein (22). To investigate further the association of the expression of the MDR1 gene in human cancers with drug resistance, we have measured MDR1 RNA levels in many types of human cancers. We report here measurements of MDR 1 RNA levels in >400 human cancer specimens. Our results identify four groups of cancers: (a) cancers that usually express high levels of MDR1 RNA, (b) cancers that occasionally express high levels, (c) cancers that rarely express MDR1 RNA, and (d) cancers that express the MDR1 gene at elevated levels after exposure to chemotherapeutic agents. Taken together, these results are consistent with an important role for the MDR1 gene in clinical drug resistance and suggest that measurements of MDR1 RNA can be useful in the design of chemotherapeutic protocols for certain tumors. Materials and Methods Cell lines KB-3-1 is the drug-sensitive parental KB (HeLa) cell line. KB-8-5, which is four times as resistant to doxorubicin and six times as resistant to vinblastine, was derived in two steps from KB-3-1 by selection in colchicine (4). KB-8-5 has increased levels of MDR 1 mRNA without gene amplification (7). Cell line KB-C1 was derived in two further steps from KB-8-5 and is 160 times more resistant to doxorubicin and 96 times more resistant to vinblastine than KB-3-1 is (6). It has amplified the MDR1 gene about 100-fold and expresses MDR1 mRNA at a very high level (7). MDR1 Hybridization Probes cDNA was prepared with the use of RNA from KB-C2.5 cells, which contain large amounts of MDR1 mRNA, and was inserted into the EcoRI site of bacteriophage Xgtll (75). Probe 5A, which encodes about one-third of the coding region of a full-length MDR1 cDNA, was labeled by nick translation before use in the RNA slot blot analyses (75). An MDR1 genomic fragment of 785 base pairs (bp) that was derived from PvuII-digested plasmid pMDR-P2 was used to make a riboprobe with SP6 polymerase for the RNase protection assays. This fragment contains the transcription-initiation sites of the downstream promoter and additional sequences 5' to the downstream promoter (23). Deoxycytidine 5'-[a-32P]triphosphate (3,000 Ci/mmol; Ci = 37 GBq) and uridine 5'-[a-32P]triphosphate (3,000 Ci/mmol) were from DuPont/NEN Products (Boston, MA). Promega Biotec (Madison, WI) was the source of the PGEM4 and the Riboprobe Gemini System II. The Amersham Corporation (Arlington Heights, IL) manufactured the nick-translation system. RNA Extraction and Electrophoresis All samples were stored frozen at —70 °C. Before RNA extraction, solid tumors were pulverized on a metal surface on a bed of dry ice. Buffy coats from leukemia samples or leukemia blast cells isolated by Ficoll-Hypaque gradient centrifugation and frozen in 10% dimethyl sulfoxide were thawed rapidly at 37 °C and centrifuged. For lung cancer and mesothelioma, cell lines were available for analysis. The lung cancer cell lines were established, grown, and characterized as previously described (24-28). Tissue culture dishes and flasks of cell lines were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline without calcium and magnesium. Total cellular RNA was extracted by homogenization in guanidinium isothiocyanate followed by centrifugation over a cesium chloride cushion (29) or by acid-phenol extraction (30). The RNA was electrophoresed in 1% agarose-6% formaldehyde gels. One microgram of total RNA was loaded per lane. The ribosomal RNA appeared undegraded in almost all samples reported here. Samples with degraded RNA were not further analyzed. Slot Blot Analysis Nitrocellulose filters were presoaked in 10X SSC (IX SSC = 0.15 M NaCl/15 mAf sodium citrate, pH 7). Serial dilutions of 10, 3, 1, and 0.3 ng of each sample of total RNA in 10X SSC were applied to each well of a Schleicher and Schuell slot.blot apparatus. After baking at 80 °C in a vacuum oven, the filters were prehybridized for 4-6 hours at 42 °C in 50% formamide, 5X SSC, 5X Denhardt's solution (IX Denhart's solution = 0.02% Ficoll, 0.02% polyvinylpyrrolidone, and 0.02% acetylated bovine serum albumin), 50 mAf sodium phosphate (pH 6.5), and 200 jxg of salmon sperm DNA/mL. The filters were then hybridized for 16 hours at 42 °C in 50% formamide, 5X SSC, IX Denhardt's solution, 10% dextran sulfate, 100 /ng of salmon sperm DNA/mL, and 20 mAf sodium phosphate (pH 6.5) with 5 X 106 cpm of nick-translated cDNA/mL. After hybridization, the filters were washed four times for a total of 1 hour with IX SSC/0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) at 23 °C followed by two 10-minute washes with 0.2X SSC/0.1% SDS at 50 °C. Autoradiographs were exposed for 1-5 days. Hybridization with a nick-translated 7-actin probe (31) was performed to compare RNA loading. RNase Protection Assay The starting sites of MDR 1 transcription in various human cell lines and tumors were mapped with an RNase protection Vol. 81, No. 2, January 18, 1989 ARTICLES 117 Downloaded from https://academic described (23,32). Results Quantitation of MDRl RNA MDRl RNA was routinely measured by a slot blot procedure in which various amounts of RNA from unknown and known samples were applied to the same blot A typical RNA slot blot is illustrated in figure 1. RNA from KB-3-1 cells, which are drug sensitive, and RNA from KB-8-5 cells, which are about fivefold multidrug resistant, were included in each blot Relative to KB-3-1 cells, the KB-8-5 cells have a 30- to 40-fold increase in MDRl mRNA (77). On this basis, the signal intensity of 10 /ig of KB-8-5 total RNA was assigned an arbitrary value of 30 U. The value of the signal from each tumor is expressed relative to that of the signal from KB-8-5 RNA. KB-8-5 RNA gives a reproducible and easily detectable signal. To ensure reproducibility of results, we normalized the quantity of RNA loaded for the amount of actin RNA detected. Normalization was usually not necessary, since the amount of RNA was similar in all the blots (fig. 1). Cancers With High Levels of MDRl RNA MDRl expression was considered to be high if >50% of the cancers in each group had detectable levels of MDRl RNA. In a substantial proportion of the cancers, MDRl RNA levels were >30 U (table 1). Levels of MDRl RNA were high in several types of untreated cancers, including colon cancer, renal cell carcinoma, hepatoma, adrenocortical carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, islet cell tumor of the pancreas, chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in blast crisis, and carcinoid tumor, as well as in cell lines of non-small cell lung cancer with neuroendocrine properties (NSCLC-NE). Typical results from colon and adrenocortical carcinomas are shown in figure 1. The range of signals in four carcinoid tumors is illustrated by the RNA analysis in figure 2. We performed RNase protection experiments to determine whether MDRl RNA in these specimens that contained elevated RNA levels initiated only at the downstream promoter used by normal human tissues or also at an upstream promoter detected in some multidrug-resistant cell lines. RNA preparations from most colon carcinomas and adrenocortical cancers and some carcinoid tumors, leukemias, and pheochromocytomas containing >30 U of MDRl RNA were used for these analyses (fig. 3). For these analyses, a 785-bp RNA, representing genomic sequences encompassing the promoter region and MOO bp of the 5' region of the MDRl mRNA, was hybridized with the RNA samples in solution and then digested with RNase. Two fragments were detected when RNA from KB-8-5 cells and RNA from KB-C1 cells were analyzed, corresponding to two major transcription-initiation sites. The two fragments of 323 and 130 bp, respectively, are indicated by arrows on figure 3 and correspond to mRNA initiated at the upstream and the downstream promoters. In the specimens listed above from patients who had not previously received chemotherapy, only initiation from the downstream site was detected. The amounts of MDRl RNA detected by RNase protection were similar to those detected by the slot blot analyses, which validates the use of slot blots for detecting MDRl RNA Cancers With Low or Undetectable Levels of MDRl RNA A large variety of untreated cancers were found to have generally low (<30 U) or undetectable levels of MDRl RNA. These cancers included breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), bladder cancer, CML in chronic phase, esophageal carcinoma, gastric carcinoma, head and neck cancer, melanoma, mesothelioma, ovarian carcinoma, prostate cancer, sarcoma, small cell lung cancer (SCLC), thymoma, thyroid cancer, and Wilms' tumor (table 3). For nine specimens of squamous cell carcinoma of the lung (included in NSCLC), adjacent normal lung and tumor tissues from each patient were evaluated for expression, and no significant difference in MDRl RNA expression was found (data not shown). Figure 4 illustrates the distribution of MDRl RNA expression in a few representative untreated cancers. Because of the wide range of RNA expression detected, a log scale was used. In this graph it is evident that most of the specimens of adrenocortical cancer and colorectal cancer had relatively high levels of MDRl RNA, whereas most of the breast cancer specimens and most of the Wilms' tumor specimens had undetectable MDRl RNA levels, with only a few samples having low MDRl RNA levels. Levels of MDRl RNA in Relapsed Cancers Cancers that were initially sensitive to chemotherapy but that relapsed after treatment were also examined. Table 4 lists those cancers in which we found high levels of MDRl RNA after treatment with chemotherapy. These cancers included non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, neuroblastoma, pheochromocytoma, breast cancer, CML in blast crisis, adult ALL, and adult ANLL. In most cases we were not able to obtain specimens from the same patient before and after treatment However, we did obtain such specimens from one child with ALL (Rothenberg M, Mickley L, Cole D, et al.: manuscript submitted for publication), from one patient with pheochromocytoma, and from two patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. One of the two patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma had an MDRl RNA level of 8 prior to chemotherapy. This patient was then treated with ProMACE-MOPP chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, etoposide, prednisone, mechlorethamine, vincristine, and procarbazine). At disease relapse, the MDRl RNA level increased to 24. This tumor was a nodular, poorly differentiated lymphoma. The other lymphoma specimen studied was also of an indolent histology. Discussion Common Expression of MDR1 Gene in Cancers In this study using RNA slot blot analysis, we have measured the expression of the MDR1 gene in >400 human cancers. Our results show that slot blot analysis is a sensitive method for quantitation of the MDR1 gene expression in human tumors and that many human tumors express MDR1 RNA. We have identified a group of untreated cancers that usually have elevated levels of MDR1 RNA. This group includes colon cancer, adrenocortical cancer, pheochromocytoma, hepatoma, pancreatic carcinoma, and renal cell carcinoma. All of these cancers are derived from tissues that normally have relatively high levels of MDR1 RNA. These findings confirm that the MDR1 gene can continue to be expressed when a normal cell undergoes malignant transformation. All of these cancers are known to be clinically resistant to chemotherapy, and thus the MDR1 gene may be implicated in their intrinsic drug resistance. Variability in MDR1 Expression Within the group of cancers with high MDR1 RNA levels, we observed considerable variation from cancer to cancer (fig. 4). For example, the highest MDR1 RNA level in colon cancer was 60 and the lowest was 0; the highest adrenal cancer MDR1 RNA level was 90 and the lowest was 0. This variation was not a technical artifact due to the quality of RNA because all RNA samples were checked for intactness of the RNA by gels and for quantity by analysis of actin RNA levels. However, a number of other factors need further examination. One is the number of cancer cells and stromal cells in each specimen. Stromal cells such as fibroblasts and inflammatory cells tend to have very low MDR1 RNA levels. A second factor is the state of differentiation of the cancer. We have observed in kidney cancers (79) and colon cancers (Fojo A: unpublished data) that MDR1 RNA levels tend to be lower in less differentiated cancers. A third factor is the cell type from which the cancer emerges. For example, in the kidney, most cancers showed histological evidence of being derived from proximal tubules (33), and the MDR1 gene was preferentially expressed in proximal tubules. In the pancreas, the MDR1 gene was preferentially expressed in collecting ductules. Although we have examined only four pancreatic cancers, the variable expression in this cancer could reflect the origin of the tumor. Within the various types of lung tumors that have been examined, only one group, NSCLC-NE, tended to have high MDR1 RNA levels. A detailed analysis of this group will be published elsewhere (Lai S-L, Goldstein LJ, Gottesman MM, et al.: manuscript in preparation). The group of untreated cancers that occasionally had high MDR1 RNA levels included ALL, ANLL, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and neuroblastoma. These cancers are usually sensitive to chemotherapy. It will be important to'gather more data to determine if the occasionally elevated levels of MDR1 RNA are associated with the occasional treatment failures seen in these cancers. Low or undetectable levels of MDR1 RNA were seen in many cancers, including some that are drug sensitive and several others that are generally considered to be resistant or poorly responsive to chemotherapy (e.g., lung cancers). Other mechanisms of drug resistance probably operate in these cancers, or heterogeneity of MDR1 RNA expression could account for resistant subpopulations in these cancers. In the case of breast cancer and NSCLC, some expression of MDR1 RNA was seen in 15%-36% of the tumors examined, which is consistent with the latter possibility. For breast cancer, in particular, in which most of the cells may be stromal, a low level of MDR1 RNA expression could be significant. To investigate the existence of heterogeneous expression, immunohistochemical or in situ hybridization studies of tumor specimens may allow one to distinguish the differential expression of various cell subpopulations. Acquired Drug Resistance Several lines of evidence now exist that indicate expression of the MDR1 gene may be partly responsible for acquired clinical drug resistance. In addition to the data reported here showing increased MDR1 RNA levels in ALL, ANLL, lymphoma, breast cancer, pheochromocytoma, CML in blast crisis, and neuroblastoma, antibodies have been used to demonstrate significant levels of P-glycoprotein in some patients with treated ovarian carcinoma, sarcoma, and leukemia (20-22). Clearly, further analysis of pretreatment and posttreatment MDR1 RNA levels and/or P-glycoprotein levels in the same patient is needed to prove the association of increased MDR 1 RNA levels with acquired drug resistance. In tumors with acquired drug resistance, the measurement of elevated MDR1 RNA levels may help direct further chemotherapy by suggesting that agents affected by the multidrug-resistance phenotype (i.e., Vinca alkaloids, anthracyclines, and epipodophyllotoxins) not be used and that alternative treatments be considered. In addition to observing elevated MDR1 RNA levels in cancers that were intrinsically resistant or that had acquired resistance after treatment, we observed increased MDR1 RNA levels in three patients with CML who had undergone blast crisis. This result raises the possibility that some step that leads to cancer progression, perhaps oncogene activation, could also lead to expression of the MDR1 gene. It has been previously reported that MDR1 RNA levels are elevated in chemically induced tumors of the liver (34), a result consistent with simultaneous activation of an oncogene and MDR1 RNA expression. Characterization of MDR1 RNA in Cancers RNase protection assays of many cancers that had positive expression confirmed the expression data of slot blot analysis. This protection assay is more specific than the slot blot assay, since the protection assay does not detect RNA transcribed from the closely related MDR2 gene, which has not been associated with multidrug resistance (12,35). The RNase protection assay has also allowed us to determine that transcription of the MDR1 gene in cancers of the colon and adrenal gland and carcinoid tumors occurs from the downstream promoter, as does transcription in normal adrenal glands and colon tissues (23). Because some drug-resistant tissue culture cell lines also use an upstream promoter, we have continued analyzing cancers to determine which promoters are used. We have found that in the specimens from two of the four children with ALL with elevated MDR1 RNA levels reported here, transcription initiated at both the upstream and downstream promoters; in contrast, in the specimens from the other two children, only the upstream promoter was used (Rothenberg M, Fojo A: unpublished data). The use of two promoter sites has also been seen in both treated and un- Evidence linking MDR1 Expression to Multidrug Resistance Our results have shown that cancers which are clinically drug resistant generally have elevated MDR1 RNA levels. Several lines of evidence suggest that multidrug resistance in cancers with elevated MDR1 expression is due, at least in part, to this expression: (a) when full-length cDNAs for the human or mouse MDR1 gene are transfected (36,37) or infected into human cells (38,39), these cells become multidrug resistant; (b) unselected cell lines from tumors, such as renal adenocarcinoma with elevated MDR1 RNA levels, have a multidrug-resistant phenotype, and their resistance is reversible by use of verapamil and quinidine (40), which are inhibitors of the multidrug transporter (14); and (c) there is some correlation between MDR1 RNA levels in renal adenocarcinomas and resistance of tumor explants to vinblastine (19). Based on these results, controlled clinical trials in patients with colorectal and renal cancers are under way with the use of quinidine as a reversing agent in conjunction with cytotoxic therapy including doxorubicin, etoposide, and vinblastine. Another direction of further investigation will be to develop other less toxic reversing agents.	Lori J.

15	2000	A Family of Drug Transporters: the Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins	The human multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) family currently has seven members. The ability of several of these membrane proteins to transport a wide range of anticancer drugs out of cells and their presence in many tumors make them prime suspects in unexplained cases of drug resistance, although proof that they contribute to clinical drug resistance is still lacking. Recent studies have begun to clarify the function of the MRP family members. MRPs are organic anion transporters; i.e., they transport anionic drugs, exemplified by methotrexate, and neutral drugs conjugated to acidic ligands, such as glutathione (GSH), glucuronate, or sulfate. However, MRP1, MRP2, and MRP3 can also cause resistance to neutral organic drugs that are not known to be conjugated to acidic ligands by transporting these drugs together with free GSH. MRP1 can even confer resistance to arsenite and MRP2 to cisplatin, again probably by transporting these compounds in complexes with GSH. MRP4 overexpression is associated with high-level resistance to the nucleoside analogues 9-(2-phosphonylmethoxyethyl) adenine and azidothymidine, both of which are used as antihuman immunodeficiency virus drugs. MRPs may, therefore, also have a role in resistance against nucleoside analogues used in cancer chemotherapy. Mice without Mrp1, a high-affinity leukotriene C4 transporter, have an altered response to inflammatory stimuli but are otherwise healthy and fertile. MRP2 is the major transporter responsible for the secretion of bilirubin glucuronides into bile, and humans without MRP2 develop a mild liver disease known as the Dubin–Johnson syndrome. The physiologic functions of the other MRPs are not known. Whether long-term inhibition of MRPs in humans can be tolerated (assuming that suitable inhibitors will be found) remains to be determined. [J Natl Cancer Inst 2000;92:1295–302] Drug pumps are an important part of the defense of cells against carcinostatic drugs. This was first realized by the Danish physician Danø (1), who demonstrated in 1973 that multidrugresistant (MDR) Ehrlich ascites cells were able to lower their intracellular daunorubicin concentration by active drug extrusion. In 1976, Juliano and Ling (2) discovered a large glycoprotein in the plasma membrane of MDR cells, the P-glycoprotein (P-gp), that looked like a good candidate pump. It took a long time, however, before most scientists in the field were convinced that P-gp was a so-called “primary active” drug pump, i.e., a protein able to bind and transport drugs against a drug concentration gradient and at the expense of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis (3,4). In 1992, Cole et al. (5) discovered a second type of drug P-gp’s (6) [and a distant relative of P-gp, the bile salt transporter (7)], it is shown to contain many more genes related to MRP (8,9). This MRP family is the subject of this review. We will focus on the ability of MRPs to transport anticancer drugs and the possible contribution of MRPs to drug resistance in patients. Other aspects of MRPs have been summarized in depth in recent reviews and review volumes that deal with multidrug resistance (10–12) or with ABC transporters (ATP-binding cassette transporters) in general (13,14). OVERVIEW OF THE MEMBERS OF THE MRP FAMILY Since several laboratories have contributed to the characterization of the MRP family, individual members may have multiple names (Table 1). MRP7 is a recent addition to the family and has not yet been characterized. The six MRPs studied thus far fall into one of two groups (Table 2 and Fig. 1). MRP1, MRP2, MRP3, and MRP6 all have the extra N-terminal domain (indicated as TMD0 in Fig. 1) that is lacking in P-gp. The percent identity of MRP4 and MRP5 with MRP1 is below 40%; these two MRPs are also smaller than MRP1, and they appear to lack the TMD0 domain. Nevertheless, MRP4 and MRP5 are much more homologous to the other MRPs than to P-gp or other classes of ABC transporters. Moreover, investigators (15) have shown that the TMD0 part of MRP1 is not required for transport activity. The essential L0 part of MRP1 (see Fig. 1) is, however, conserved in the long N-terminal intracellular parts of MRP4 and MRP5 (15,16). Table 3 summarizes the tissue distribution of MRPs. It also includes what is known about the physiologic functions of these transporters (MRP1 and MRP2 only). MRP1: TRANSPORTER OF A REMARKABLE RANGE OF DRUGS The substrate specificity of MRP1 initially seemed to be similar to that of P-gp, as shown in Table 4, which compares the drug resistance profile of transfected cells overexpressing MDR1 P-gp or MRP1. Although MRP1 transports paclitaxel relatively poorly, other differences with P-gp initially seemed minor. Subsequent work showed, however, that the preferred substrates for MRP1 are organic anions (17–19), e.g., drugs conjugated to glutathione (GSH), glucuronate, or sulfate (10,11,20), whereas P-gp has a low affinity for such negatively charged compounds. In fact, MRP1 is one of the elusive glutathione-S-conjugate (GSX) pumps (21), a transporter able to transport drugs conjugated to GSH out of the cell. This explains the ability of MRP1 to transport substrates, such as methotrexate (MTX) or arsenite (H3AsO3). MTX is an organic anion; H3AsO3 can form a complex with three GSH molecules as shown in equation 1: H3AsO3 + 3GSH→← As(SG)3 + 3H2O [1] Arsenite Glutathione Complex Moreover, it is presumably this complex that is transported by MRP1, as indicated by the ability of H3AsO3 to induce increased GSH export from cells with elevated levels of MRP1 (22). MRP2: TRANSPORTER OF ANTICANCER DRUGS Long before MRP1 was discovered, biochemical and genetic studies (11,23,24) had demonstrated the presence of an organic anion transporter in the canalicular membrane of hepatocytes. This transporter was originally known as the canalicular multispecific organic anion transporter (cMOAT), but it is now called MRP2. Its substrate specificity was defined in detail with the help of a rat strain (TR−/GY) lacking cMOAT. These TR−/ GY rats are mainly deficient in bilirubin-glucuronide secretion, and they are now known to contain inactivating mutations in their cMOAT/MRP2 gene (25,26), just like their human counterparts, i.e., patients with the Dubin–Johnson syndrome (27,28). Because MRP2 was known to handle a similar range of GSH conjugates as MRP1, it was to be expected that MRP2 would also be able to transport the carcinostatic agents transported by MRP1. This expectation is borne out by recent experiments with transfected cells. Introduction of an antisense construct containing a long segment of DNA complementary to MRP2 RNA into cultured liver HepG2 cells enhanced the sensitivity of these cells to cisplatin, vincristine, doxorubicin, and the camptothecin derivatives CPT11 and SN38 but not to etoposide (29). MRP2 was also shown to mediate vinblastine transport in polarized cells (30). In transfected cells, overexpression of MRP2 resulted in resistance to MTX (31), cisplatin, etoposide, doxorubicin, epirubicin (32), and mitoxantrone (unpublished results from our laboratory). This list is not yet complete because it has been difficult to get transfected cells in which the MRP2 is routed efficiently to the plasma membrane (12,32). The spectrum of drug resistance induced in cells by MRP2 may eventually turn out to be similar to that shown for MRP1 (Table 4) with one exception: MRP2 induces cisplatin resistance (9,32,33), which has never been seen in cells overexpressing MRP1. MRP1 AND MRP2: TRANSPORT OF VINCA ALKALOIDS AND ANTHRACYCLINES Vinca alkaloids and anthracyclines are weak organic bases and are not known to be conjugated to acidic ligands in human cells. It is, therefore, puzzling that elevated levels of MRP1 or MRP2 result in resistance to these compounds. GSH is required for resistance, however. Depletion of cellular GSH abolished MRP1-mediated resistance against vinca alkaloids and anthracyclines (22,34); moreover, in vesicular transport experiments, transport of vincristine or daunorubicin occurred only in the presence of reduced GSH (35–38). The drugs are probably cotransported with GSH (36–38). In polarized kidney cells transfected with an MRP2 construct, the increased transport of vinblastine is associated with a stoichiometrically increased export of GSH (unpublished data from our laboratory). It, therefore, looks as if drug resistance mediated by MRP1 or MRP2 requires a continuing supply of GSH to allow export of unconjugated drug, as indicated in Fig. 2. Indeed, there is often a simultaneous increase in expression of MRP1 and gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase in tumor cells (39,40). MRP3 Recent work has shown that MRP3 is also an organic anion transporter (41,42); however, unlike MRP1 and MRP2, it prefers glucuronate conjugates as substrates over GSH conjugates (41). It has been difficult to get transfected, nonpolarized cells with high levels of MRP3; cells with low amounts of MRP3 are resistant to etoposide and teniposide but not to other drugs affected by multidrug resistance. Resistance to short-term exposure to MTX also has been observed in these cells (42), which is in agreement with the observation that MRP3 can transport MTX in vesicular transport experiments (41). In view of the technical problems with transfected cells, the true range of resistance that can be induced by overexpression of MRP3 obviously remains to be sorted out. The physiologic function of MRP3 remains to be established. The massive increase in the expression of MRP3 seen in the liver of cholestatic rats (43,44) and humans, quoted in (11,42), suggests that MRP3, located in the basolateral membrane of the hepatocyte (42,45), may allow efflux of organic anions from the liver into the blood when secretion into bile is blocked. A role for MRP3 in the normal uptake of bile salts from the gut has also been postulated. Why MRP3 expression is high in the adrenal cortex (42) remains to be determined. MRP4, A NUCLEOTIDE ANALOGUE PUMP Schuetz et al. (46) recently made the interesting discovery that MRP4 can function as a cellular efflux pump for the antihuman immunodeficiency virus drugs 9-(2-phosphonylmethoxyethyl) adenine (PMEA) and azidothymidine monophosphate (AZTMP) in PMEA-resistant cells. High levels of MRP4 severely impaired the antiviral efficacy of several nucleoside analogues. MRP4 can also confer resistance against 9-(2- phosphonylmethoxyethyl)guanine, a compound with some antineoplastic activity. In view of the results obtained with MRP5 (see below), it seems likely that MRP4 may also be able to cause resistance to anticancer base analogues (e.g., 6-mercaptopurine and thioguanine), but this hypothesis has not yet been tested. PMEA and AZTMP are organic anions; therefore, MRP4 can be considered to be an organic anion transporter, as is expected for an MRP family member. MRP4 might, however, be specific for phosphate conjugates, and it remains to be seen whether MRP4 can also transport GSH, glucuronide, or sulfate conjugates. MRP5 Our work with transfected cells shows that MRP5 is an organic anion transporter of GSH conjugates and that MRP5 can be inhibited by typical organic anion transport inhibitors like sulfinpyrazone and benzbromarone but not by probenecid (47). McAleer et al. (48) also found decreased accumulation of anionic fluorochromes in MRP5-transfected cells. It is interesting that we found that MRP5 overexpression results in low-level resistance to thiopurines (e.g., 6-mercaptopurine and thioguanine), as well as PMEA, but no notable resistance to other anticancer drugs tested (e.g., anthracyclines, vinca alkaloids, podophyllotoxins, or MTX). The transfected cells tend to accumulate less 6-mercaptopurine and PMEA and extrude increased amounts of 6-thioinosinemonophosphate and PMEA from the cell. Like MRP4, MRP5, therefore, appears to be a nucleotide analogue pump. McAleer et al. (48) found that cells transfected with an MRP5 gene construct are resistant to heavy metals (e.g., cadmium chloride and potassium antimonyl tartrate). We did not detect such a resistance in our cells overproducing MRP5. Like MRP2, however, MRP5 does not route efficiently to the plasma membrane in nonpolarized cells, and most of the protein remains in intracellular membranes. More work is, therefore, required to determine the full range of drug resistance that can be caused by MRP5. Since 6-mercaptopurine and thioguanine are used in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), it will be interesting to look at MRP5 and MRP4 in 6-mercaptopurine- or thioguanine-resistant ALLs or AMLs in which resistance cannot be attributed to mutations in the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase gene. The physiologic function of MRP5 remains to be determined. Mice homozygous for a disrupted Mrp5 gene are viable and healthy at least up to 1 year (47). MRP6 Both the physiologic function and the potential involvement of MRP6 in drug resistance are still unclear. It has been shown recently (49,50) that the 3 end of the MRP6 protein is almost identical to the anthracycline resistance-associated (ARA) protein identified previously in epirubicin-selected leukemia cells (51–53). MRP6 is highly expressed in the liver and kidneys and to a low extent in a few other tissues (49). Overexpression and amplification of the complete or partial MRP6 gene in resistant tumor cells were found only in cell lines with high overexpression and amplification of the MRP1 gene. It seems likely that MRP6 does not play a role in the resistance of these cells and that MRP6, or part of it (ARA), is only coamplified with MRP1 because of its location immediately next to it on chromosome 16 (49).1 INHIBITORS OF MRPS The potential involvement of drug pumps in clinical drug resistance has led to a search for compounds that can be used to inhibit these transporters in cancer patients. In the case of MDR1 P-gp, this search has been successful. Examples of effective inhibitors are the nonimmunosuppressive cyclosporin A analogue PSC833 and the carboxamide derivative GG918 [reviewed in (54–56)]. Attempts to find inhibitors for MRPs have concentrated mainly on MRP1 and MRP2. Compounds that efficiently block MDR1 P-gp only have a low affinity for MRP1 or MRP2 (57); therefore, it is unlikely that these compounds will be useful for inhibiting MRPs in human cancer. Most highaffinity substrates for MRP1 and MRP2 are organic anions with a substantial hydrophobic moiety and at least one, but preferably two, negative charge(s). Examples of potent competitive inhibitors are high-affinity substrates, such as leukotriene C4, Sdecylglutathione, and the leukotriene D4 antagonist MK571 (35,58). Other inhibitors for MRP1 are organic acids that were originally developed to inhibit transport of uric acid, like sulfinpyrazone, benzbromarone, and probenecid [see, for example, Hollo´] et al. (59)]. Although MRP1 and MRP2 have a similar substrate specificity, inhibitors for MRP1 are not necessarily good inhibitors for MRP2. Sulfinpyrazone, for instance, does not inhibit transport of the model substrate dinitrophenyl Sglutathione by MRP2 (30). Negatively charged compounds do not readily enter cells. They, therefore, do not provide obvious lead compounds for drug development. Good inhibitors probably have to be made as prodrugs in which the charged moiety is shielded. MRPS AND PROTECTION OF NORMAL TISSUES AGAINST ANTICANCER DRUGS The contribution of drug transporters to the protection of normal mammalian tissues has been investigated by disrupting the genes for these transporters in mice, resulting in “knockout,” null, or (−/−) mice. Experiments on Mdr1a/b (−/−) mice have shown that P-gp plays a major role in normal drug handling (60). The location of P-gp in the gut epithelium helps to prevent entry of drugs into the body (61); its location in renal tubules and in the canalicular membrane of the hepatocytes helps to clear drugs from the body; and its presence in strategic locations in brain (62), testis, and placenta helps to protect these organs and the fetus against drugs (63). P-gp is invariably located in the apical membrane of epithelial cells, in the appropriate position for its protective role. MRP1, in contrast, is located basolaterally (64) and, therefore, tends to pump drugs into the body. Indeed, no decreased disposal of drugs has been observed in Mrp1 (−/−) mice (65–67). Nevertheless, these mice are hypersensitive to etoposide (65), and we have found that MRP1 has nonredundant protective functions against etoposide in the bone marrow, the epithelium of the oropharynx, the testicular tubules, and the urinarycollecting duct cells (68). Especially interesting is the protection of the testicular tubules. As illustrated in Fig. 3, the basolateral location of Mrp1 in the Sertoli cells allows this pump to protect the contents of the testicular tubules, the germline cells, against drug damage. A similar situation appears to exist in the choroid plexus, where many substances enter the cerebrospinal fluid from the epithelial cells covering the plexus. The high level of Mrp1 in these cells (69,70) plays a crucial role in preventing the entry of a drug, such as etoposide, into the cerebrospinal fluid (71). Hardly anything is known about the possible protective role of MRPs other than MRP1. An Mrp5 (−/−) mouse exists (47), but it has not yet been analyzed in detail. MRPS AND CLINICAL MULTIDRUG RESISTANCE P-gp was discovered in 1976 (2). Today, 24 years later, there is still no consensus on its contribution to drug resistance in cancer patients. The first MRP, MRP1, was discovered only 8 years ago (5); therefore, it is not surprising that we still do not know much about its clinical significance. Because MRP1 is ubiquitous in human tissues (Table 3), it is potentially present in most tumors and could, therefore, play a role in resistance. Indeed, MRP1 has been detected in almost every tumor type examined, but no strong association has emerged between MRP1 levels and clinical resistance [reviewed in (10)]. In the absence of effective and specific MRP inhibitors, it is impossible to analyze the possible contribution of MRP1 to resistance by use of intervention studies in which anticancer drugs transported by MRP1 are combined with an inhibitor of MRP1. No association between the expression of MRP2 and multidrug resistance was ever found in cell lines selected for multidrug resistance. However, MRP2 was found in 95% of renal clear-cell carcinomas, and MRP2 was also detected in lung, gastric, colorectal, and hepatocellular carcinomas [reviewed in (11)]. Initial studies on MRP3 (9) did not find any association between MRP3 and drug resistance in cell lines, but a more recent survey of lung cancer cell lines (72) showed a strong association between MRP3 and doxorubicin resistance and a weaker association between MRP3 and resistance to vincristine, etoposide, and cisplatin. The potential contribution of MRP4–7 to multidrug resistance remains to be studied. MRPS AND CLINICAL MTX RESISTANCE Biochemical experiments have identified several different GS-X pumps that are able to extrude MTX from erythrocytes and leukemic cells (31,73,74), and several lines of evidence support the idea that these pumps might be identical to MRPs. For example, MTX excretion into bile is diminished in TR− rats lacking MRP2 (75), and vesicular transport of MTX is increased in membrane vesicles from cells with increased MRP1 levels (31) and decreased in erythrocytes from Mrpl (−/−) mice (unpublished results from our laboratory). Nevertheless, no MTX resistance was found in cells overexpressing any MRP during continuous MTX exposure. This paradox was resolved when Jansen and co-workers (31,42) found that MRP1, MRP2, and MRP3 do protect cells polyglutamates are not detectably transported by MRP1, and the gradual accumulation of these polyglutamates in chronically exposed cells may explain the loss of resistance during long-term drug exposure. It is possible that polyglutamylation of folates also prevents depletion of cellular folate pools by MRP, but this hypothesis has not yet been analyzed. The results now available suggest that at least some of the MTX-transporting GS-X pumps, identified in cultured cells by Henderson and co-workers (73,74), are actually MRP1, MRP2, and MRP3. Whether raised levels of MRPs could contribute to MTX resistance in vivo has not yet been studied. MRPS AND CLINICAL CISPLATIN OR ARSENITE RESISTANCE Ishikawa et al. (76) first pointed out that cisplatin can form complexes with GSH (equation 2): (NH32PtCl2 + 2GSH→← NH32Pt-SG2 + 2HC1 [2] Cisplatin Glutathione Complex Moreover, they (76) showed that these complexes are themselves toxic and that they might be removed from the cells by a GS-X pump. All attempts to demonstrate transport of cisPt- (SG)2 complexes by MRP1 have failed, but there is now good evidence that MRP2 could mediate cisplatin resistance, as discussed above. Whether there is any association between clinical cisplatin resistance and raised MRP2 levels in tumors remains to be studied. Clinical interest in arsenite comes from observations showing that arsenite treatment can induce remissions in promyelocytic leukemia, probably by promoting apoptosis [see (77,78)]. Clinical resistance against arsenite arises rapidly during treatment, and it seems possible that overexpression of MRPs could be involved in some forms of resistance. Although vesicular trans- WHY SO MANY PUMPS? Many toxins found in nature and used by oncologists as natural- product drugs enter cells by passive diffusion. These amphipathic drugs are hydrophobic enough to diffuse through a lipid bilayer, but they are hydrophilic enough to be water soluble and to reach their target. Because of the hydrophilic parts in these drugs, they enter cells slowly. The rate of entry of doxorubicin, for instance, is measured in minutes rather than in milliseconds (81). Because doxorubicin does not require a protein to enter the cell, organisms cannot defend themselves against this drug by altering an import protein. This is an effective strategy to keep out water-soluble drugs, such as MTX, which is dependent on the reduced folate carrier for rapid cellular uptake. Once inside, these amphipathic drugs can be inactivated by oxidation and/or conjugation. However, as Ishikawa (21) pointed out, conjugation by itself is not enough to get rid of the drug. The conjugated drug is now more hydrophilic because of the GSH attached to it and cannot leave the cell by passive diffusion. As drug continues to enter the cell, the GSH conjugate will accumulate to excessive concentrations (that will be toxic in themselves) unless exported by a dedicated export pump, a GS-X pump. Genes for drug pumps and drug-conjugate pumps are prominent in all of the genomes of simple organisms sequenced. Three classes of drug (-conjugate) pumps have been found in the human genome [i.e., the P-gp’s, the MRPs, and the breast cancer resistance proteins (82–85)], with a total of 12 members identified so far. It will be a formidable task to sort out which of these pumps contributes to resistance, to which anticancer drugs, and in which tumors. The potential benefit of this knowledge to cancer treatment is, however, large. As the rapid analysis of the expression levels of thousands of genes in tumor samples is entering the phase of clinical application, it will become possible to reconstruct a resistance profile for the predominant cell types in each tumor and to adjust the chemotherapy accordingly. This should at least make it possible to spare some patients an aggressive therapy that does not work. OUTLOOK What makes the MRP family so remarkable is the range of anticancer drugs handled by its members. Whereas P-gp’s have become deservedly famous for transporting a wide range of neutral or slightly basic organic compounds, the current members of the MRP family are even more versatile. In addition to the P-gp-transported neutral organic compounds, MRP1, MRP2, and MRP3 also transport drugs conjugated to GSH, glucuronate, or sulfate and other organic anions, such as MTX. Because of the ability of these transporters to handle compounds associated with GSH, they can even cause resistance to small molecules	Piet Borst, Raymond Evers, Marcel Kool, Jan Wijnholds
16	1992	Overexpression of a Transporter Gene in a Multidrug-Resistant Human Lung Cancer Cell Line	The doxorubicin-selected lung cancer cell line H69AR is resistant to many chemotherapeutic agents. However, like most tumor samples from individuals with this disease, it does not overexpress P-glycoprotein, a transmembrane transport protein that is dependent on adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and is associated with multidrug resistance. Complementary DNA (cDNA) clones corresponding to messenger RNAs (mRNAs) overexpressed in H69AR cells were isolated. One cDNA hybridized to an mRNA of 7.8 to 8.2 kilobases that was 100- to 200-fold more expressed in H69AR cells relative to drug-sensitive parental H69 cells. Overexpression was associated with amplification of the cognate gene located on chromosome 16 at band p13.1. Reversion to drug sensitivity was associated with loss of gene amplification and a marked decrease in mRNA expression. The mRNA encodes a member of the ATP-binding cassette transmembrane transporter superfamily. Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for 20 to 25% of all lung cancers. It differs from other forms of lung cancer, known collectively as non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC), because it is initially much more responsive to chemotherapy. Up to 90% of SCLC tumors respond to chemotherapy, but patients almost always relapse with multidrug-resistant disease. The initial response rate of NSCLC tumors is much lower and, for the most part, these tumors display inherent drug resistance. The molecular basis of drug resistance in both SCLC and NSCLC is poorly understood. Overexpression of the transmembrane transport protein P-glycoprotein has been detected in many multidrug-resistant tumor cell lines and in a variety of tumors from cancer patients with both acquired and inherent drug resistance (1). This protein is encoded by the human MDR1 gene, and in vitro studies have shown that it confers resistance to a range of natural product xenobiotics that are used as chemotherapeutic drugs (2). However, despite the widespread occurrence of drug resistance in human lung tumors, overexpression of P-glycoprotein is infrequent, which indicates the existence of alternative resistance mechanisms (3, 4). NCI-H69 (H69) is an SCLC cell line that has been used in experimental studies of lung cancer (5). We have described a multidrug-resistant variant of this cell line, designated H69AR, which was obtained by stepwise selection in doxorubicin. H69AR displays a drug resistance pattern typical of that associated with increased amounts of P-glycoprotein. However, as with most clinical specimens of SCLC, H69AR does not overexpress this protein or its cognate mRNA (6-8). Consistent with this observation, major differences in net drug accumulation or efflux do not appear to be part of the resistance phenotype of the H69AR cell line (8). Another feature that distinguishes H69AR from cell lines that overexpress P-glycoprotein is the inability of cyclosporin A and several other chemosensitizing agents to reverse doxorubicin resistance in these cells (7, 9). As part of a search for proteins responsible for the multidrug resistance displayed by H69AR cells, a randomly primed cDNA library was constructed from H69AR mRNA and screened by differential hybridization with total cDNA prepared from H69 and H69AR mRNA (10). One of the in H69AR cells, indicated by the arrow, was estimated to be 7.8 to 8.2 kb. Prolonged exposure of the film revealed small amounts of this mRNA in both H69 and H69PR cells. Molecular size standards are shown at the left. (B) Southern blot analysis of Eco RI-digested genomic DNA from H69PR, H69, and H69AR cells. DNA (10 pg) was digested with Eco RI, analyzed by electrophoresis through a 0.7% agarose gel, and blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The DNA was hybridized with a 1.8-kb Eco RI cDNA fragment of MRP that was labeled by random priming with [a-32P]dCTP. The autoradiograph shown is a 6-hour exposure at -70°C. On the basis of the examination of several restriction digests and normalization of the amounts of DNA loaded, no differences in the copy number of the gene in H69 and H69PR cells were detected. Molecular size standards are shown at left. (C) Northern blot analysis of HeLa cell poly(A)+ RNA with MRP cDNA. S3 is a drug-sensitive (S) HeLa cell line, and J2c is a drug-resistant (R) one (28). Poly(A)+ RNA (2 1g) from each cell line was analyzed by electrophoresis, blotted, and probed with MRP cDNA as described in (A). The MRP and P-actin autoradiographs shown are 18-hour and 1-hour exposures, respectively, at - 700C. clones isolated gave a particularly strong differential signal when analyzed on Northern (RNA) blots (Fig. 1A). This 2.8-kb cDNA clone hybridized with a single-size class of mRNA of approximately 7.8 to 8.2 kb, the concentration of which was increased 100- to 200-fold in H69AR cells relative to H69 cells. The amount of this mRNA in H69PR, a drug-sensitive partial revertant of H69AR (11), was approximately one-twentieth of that found in H69AR, which further substantiates the correlation of overexpression of this particular mRNA with the multidrug resistance phenotype. Southern (DNA) blot analyses of H69 and H69AR DNA indicated that the major mechanism underlying overexpression was gene amplification. Consistent with this suggestion, amplification was lost in H69PR cells (Fig. 1B). The mRNA was also overexpressed 12- to 15-fold in a doxorubicinselected HeLa cell line that is multidrugresistant and that does not overexpress P-glycoprotein (Fig. 1C), and the cognate gene was amplified to a comparable degree (12). This finding provided further evidence of the association of elevated amounts of this mRNA with multidrug resistance. We sequenced the initial 2.8-kb cDNA Hum/HRP clone in order to isolate overlapping clones by rescreening the H69AR cDNA library with synthetic oligonucleotides. A single open reading frame of 1522 amino acids was defined, encoding a protein we have designated as multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP). The translated GenBank/European Molecular Biology Laboratory and SwissProt databases were searched for simi- Deduced amino acid sequence (26) of MRP aligned with the amino acid sequence of ItpgpA (Lei/PgpA). The alignment was generated with PILEUP as described in Fig. 2. The MRP sequence shown begins at the putative NH2-terminal methionine and was compiled from four overlapping Xgtl 1 cDNA clones (31). Alignment of the two proteins begins at a methionine residue 57 amino acids from the NH2-terminus of MRP that aligns with the NH2-terminal methionine of Lei/PgpA. Identical and conserved amino acids are identified by double and single dots, respectively. The Walker A and B motifs and the active transport family signature that are characteristic of nucleotide-binding folds of ABC transporters (25) are indicated by single lines and denoted A, B, and C, respectively, in bold. The predicted transmembrane regions of each protein are indicated by double lines (32). The region in Lei/PgpA underscoredCluster analysis of the relative similarity of MRP to selected members of the ABC transporter superfamily. Shown are representative members of the superfamily that contain hydrophobic transmembrane regions, followed by nucleotide-binding folds. We created a multiple sequence alignment with the PILEUP program from the Genetics Computer Group package (version 7.1) (Madison, Wisconsin) (29) using a modified version of the progressive alignment method of Feng and Doolittle (30) with a gap weight of 3.0 and a gap length weight of 0.1. To ensure that this dendrogram was representative of the actual sequence similarity, we repeated the alignment using the following modifications: (i) subsets of the sequences in order to minimize weighting effects of similar sequences, (ii) NH2- or COOH-terminal regions of sequences to reduce effects arising from the presence of two homologous NBFs, and (iii) variations in the gap creation and extension penalties and the position of arbitrary gaps to test the thoroughness of the alignment. (13). The search indicated, solely on the basis of its primary sequence, that MRP is a member of the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily of transport systems (14). Members of this superfamily are involved in the energy-dependent transport of a variety of molecules across cell membranes in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Included in this superfamily are the genes for the human multidrug transporter P-glycoprotein (MDR1) and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) (2, 15). Hum/HRP (W) Lei/PgpA (N) HuM/CFTR (N) Hum/ldrI (W) Hum/IRP (N) ei/PqPA (N) Hum/CFTR (N) Hum/lIdrI (N) Hum/HRP (C) Loi/PgpA (C) Hum/CFTR (C) Hum/IHdrl (C) HuM/NRP (C) Lei/PgpA (C) Hum/CFTR (C) Hum/Mdrl (C) A a~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ C N A iS GIRSRV SE-S The relation ofMRP to various members of the ABC transporter superfamily was examined with a program that generates a dendrogram of relative protein similarities. A representative selection of a phylogenetically broad range of ABC proteins that are composed of hydrophobic transmembrane regions followed by nucleotide-binding regions, and whose sequences could be retrieved from the GenBank or SwissProt databases, were included in this analysis. With the use of a variety of alignment parameters, the analysis consistently divided this family of proteins into two major I WE C a Fig. 4. Alignment of the extended nucleotide-binding regions of MRP, CFTR, and Leishmania and human P-glycoproteins. Shown are the NH2-terminal (N) and the COOH-terminal (C) halves of the deduced amino acid sequence of MRP corresponding to ItpgpA (Lei/PgpA) (amino acids 650 to 799 and 1303 to 1463), Hum/CFTR (amino acids 441 to 590 and 1227 to 1385), and Hum/Mdrl (amino acids 410 to 573 and 1053 to 1215). The sequences are presented as aligned by PILEUP. White type on black background indicates that three of four amino acids at that position are identical or conserved. The conserved motifs A, B, and C described in Fig. 3 are underscored by a single line. Similarity scores for the NH2-terminal NBFs relative to MRP are as follows: Lei/PgpA, 0.93; Hum/CFTR, 0.85; and Hum/Mdr1, 0.60. Comparable COOH-terminal scores are as follows: Lei/PgpA, 0.87; Hum/CFTR, 0.84; and Hum/Mdrl, 0.73. Similarity scores for NH2- and COOHterminal NBFs in the same protein are as follows: MRP, 0.61; Lei/PgpA, 0.60; Hum/CFTR, 0.62; and Hum/Mdr1, 1.10. subgroups (Fig. 2). One consists of the cluster that contains MRP [human (Hum)/ MRP], the leishmania P-glycoprotein-related molecule (Lei/PgpA) (16), and the CFTRs [Hum/CFTR, bovine (Bov/CFTR), mouse (Mus/CFTR), and dogfish (Squ/ CFTR)]. The other consists of the P-glycoproteins, the major histocompatibility complex class II-linked peptide transporters (Hum/Tap2 and Mus/Tapl), the bacterial exporters (Eco/HlyB and Pas/LktB), the heterocyst differentiation protein (Ana/ HetA), the malarial parasite transporter (Pfa/Mdrl), and the yeast mating factor exporter (Ysc/Ste6). The dendrogram indicates that MRP is only distantly related to identified members of the ABC transporter superfamily. Although the analysis suggests that it is most closely related to Lei/PgpA, the similarity between MRP and Lei/PgpA resides predominantly in two regions, both containing signatures of nucleotide-binding folds (NBFs) (Fig. 3). It has been proposed that the bipartite structure of P-glycoproteins reflects duplication of an ancestral gene that occurred before the evolutionary separation of animals and plants (17). However, comparison of the NH2- and COOHterminal NBFs of MRP and Lei/PgpA revealed less similarity than typically found between the two corresponding regions of P-glycoproteins.

In addition, the COOH-terminal NBFs of MRP, Lei/PgpA, and Hum/CFTR are more similar to each other than to either the COOH- or NH2-terminal NBFs of Hum/Mdrl (Fig. 4). These observations, combined with the overall analysis shown in Fig. 2, suggest that MRP, Lei/PgpA, and CFTR evolved from a common ancestor that contained both NH2- and COOHterminal NBFs. Comparison with other ABC transporters indicates that this precursor probably differed from the ancestral gene of the P-glycoproteins or had diverged from it before the separation of animals and plants (17). Despite knowledge of the structure and ability of P-glycoprotein to act as a drug efflux pump, its normal physiological role has not been elucidated. Some possible clues to its function have been provided by its distribution in normal tissues. P-glycoprotein is highly expressed in secretory organs and tissues, such as the adrenal glands, kidneys, lumenal epithelium of the colon, and the murine gravid uterus. It has also been detected in the lung, although this finding is variable (4, 19). On the basis of the cell types in which it is expressed, it has been postulated that P-glycoprotein may be involved in steroid transport or protection against xenobiotics. Northern blot analyses of total RNA preparations from a range of human tissues indicate that MRP displays a different tissue profile of expression. MRP mRNA is readily detectable in lung (20), testis, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) (Fig. 5A). MRP transcripts were below the level of detection in placenta, brain, kidney, salivary gland, uterus, liver, and spleen. The human CFTR and MDR1 genes have been mapped to chromosome 7 at bands q31 and q21, respectively (21, 22). The structural similarity of MRP to these proteins prompted us to examine the possibility that the.MRP gene may be linked to one of these loci. However, in situ hybridization carried out on bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) -synchronized PBMCs demonstrated that the gene coding for MRP is located on chromosome 16 at band p13.1 (Fig. 5B). At present, the size of the amplicon containing MRP is unknown. Consequently, the possibility cannot be excluded that the amplicon contains additional genes that may be responsible for or contribute to the multidrug resistance phenotype. Although total cellular drug accumulation appears unchanged in H69AR cells (8), the possibility remains that sequestration of drugs in these resistant cells may be modified so that the drugs are less able to reach their intracellular sites of action (23). MRP may participate directly in the active transport of drugs into subcellular organelles or influence drug distribution indirectly. If MRP is involved in ion transport, its overexpression could alter cytoplasmic or intra-organelle pH. A relative decrease in intra-organelle pH would be expected to result in greater sequestration of drugs, such as the anthracyclines and Vinca alkaloids, which are protonated under acidic conditions (23, 24). The subcellular localization of MRP and the identification of the molecules it transports should provide insight into the mechanism by which this protein is involved in multidrug resistance. The isolation and characterization of MRP provides definitive molecular evidence for the existence of a transporter that may confer or at least contribute to multidrug resistance in SCLC. The overexpression of MRP in multidrug-resistant HeLa cells and inherently resistant NSCLC cell lines (20) suggests that this protein may play a role in resistance in other malignancies as well.

17	1976	A SURFACE GLYCOPROTEIN MODULATING DRUG IN CHINESE HAMSTER OVARY CELL MUTANTS	Chinese hamster ovary cells selected for resistance to colchicine display pleiotropic cross-resistance to a wide range of amphiphilic drugs. The drug-resistant phenotype is due to a membrane alteration which reduces the rate of drug permeation. Surface labelling studies reveal that drug-resistant Chinese hamster ovary cell membranes possess a carbohydrate-containing component of 170 000 daltons apparent molecular weight which is not observed in wild type cells. Through studies of the metabolic incorporation of carbohydrate and protein precursors, and through the use of selective proteolysis, this component is shown to be a cell surface glycoprotein. Since this glycoprotein appears unique to mutant cells displaying altered drug permeability, we have designated it the P glycoprotein. The relative amount of surface labelled P glycoprotein correlates with the degree of drug resistance in a number of independent mutant and revertant clones. A similar high molecular weight glycoprotein is also present in drug-resistant mutants from another hamster cell line. Observations on the molecular basis of pleiotropic drug resistance are interpreted in terms of a model wherein certain surface glycoproteins control drug permeation by modulating the properties of hydrophobic membrane regions. We have isolated from Chinese hamster ovary tissue culture cells, colchicineresistant (CH R) mutants which exhibit reduced permeability to colchicine [i ]. The degree of resistance observed in independently selected lines correlates strongly with the reduction in drug permeability. One distinguishing feature of these membranealtered mutants is their pleiotropic cross-resistance to a wide range &apparently unrelated compounds such as vinblastine, colcemid, daunomycin, puromycin, cytochalasin B and others [1-3]. Several observations provide evidence that the mutation resulting in reduced colchicine permeability also results in a pleiotropic reduction in permeability to a wide variety of compounds. First, CU R cells display reduced uptake of some of the drugs to which they are cross-resistant [4]. Second, both the CH R phenotype and the pleiotropic phenotype behave similarly in cell-cell hybrids, and are expressed as an incompletely dominant trait [2]. Third, revertants isolated in a single step from non-mutagenized cultures of highly colchicine-resistant lines possess greatly reduced resistance to colchicine and at the same time, display a reduction in resistance to other drugs [2]. Because of the marked pleiotropic nature of the membrane alteration(s) resulting in colchicine resistance, and because of the initial observations that colchicine permeates into the cell by unmediated diffusion [4, 5], we anticipated that some general alteration of the plasma membrane might be responsible for reduced drug permeability in the mutant cells. We examined the lipid composition of mutant cells, but observed no major changes (See, Y. P. and Ling, V., unpublished observations). On the other hand, we have recently made the preliminary observation that a new surface component, likely a glycoprotein, is associated with the plasma membrane of a mutant line [6]. The present study was undertaken to evaluate whether or not there is a correlation between the presence of this surface glycoprotein and the degree of colchicine resistance. Thus, we have examined the surface glycoproteins of a number of independently selected CH R clones with different degrees of resistance, as well as two independently isolated revertant clones. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Cells. The maintenance of Chinese hamster ovary cells in culture has been detailed previously [1, 7]. Cells are normally maintained at 37 °C in monolayer cultures; however, for experiments involving the labelling of cell surfaces, cells are grown in suspension cultures for greater than seven generations before use. The isolation and growth characteristics of CH R mutants have been described previously [1 ]. For this study, subclones of the original mutant lines have been employed. AUX B1 a glycine-, adenosine- and thymidine-requiring auxotroph [8], is the parental line from which the colchicine-resistant (CH R) clones were originally selected [1 ]. S, (where n = 1, 2, 3 , . . . etc.) denotes the subclone number of the original mutant line. Clones I8-31 and II0-1 are revertants selected in a single step from the highly drug-resistant lines CHRC4 and CHRC5, respectively. The isolation of revertant cells will be communicated in detail elsewhere. A preliminary report on one method of revertant isolation has already been described [2]. Surface labelling. The surface galactose and galactosamine residues of intact cells were labelled via the galactose oxidase-boro [3H]hydride technique, as described previously [7, 9, 10]. Briefly, 1 • 108-2 . 108 washed cells in 2 ml of Dttlbeccos phosphate buffer were treated with 50 units of neuraminidase, followed by 30 units of galactose oxidase, both for 5 rain at 37 °C. The enzymes were removed and the cells radiolabelled with approx. 1 mCi of tritiated borohydride for 5 min at 0 °C. Excess isotope was removed by two washes in buffer containing 1 ~ bovine albumin, followed by two further washes in buffer alone. Metabolie labelling. Total cell protein was radiolabelled via the incorporation of 3H-labelled amino acids (1-2 #Ci/ml medium) during logarithmic growth. Cell oligosaccharides were labelled through the incorporation of [~ employed here as a specific precursor for oligosaccharides, since there is probably little diversion of this substance into other biosynthetic pathways [11]. Metabolic incorporation with either isotope was continued for at least one doubling time (18-22 h). Subcellularfractionation. Chinese hamster ovary cell plasma membranes were prepared and isolated using two cycles of an aqueous polymer separation system as previously described [12]. The characteristics of such membranes have been described in detail [7, I0]. Polyacrylamide 9el electrophoresis and quantitation of radioactivity. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate was performed according to the methods of Fairbanks et al. [13]. Samples labelled via the galactose oxidase-boro[3H]hydride method were usually analyzed on 7.5 % acrylamide gel slabs. The radiolabelling patterns were visualized by impregnating the gels with 2,5-diphenyloxazole, followed by drying and autoradiography [14]. The autoradiograms were scanned with a Beckman Acta CII recording densitometer in order to quantitate the various labelled components fractionated by electrophoresis. Under these conditions, a linear correlation prevailed between the dpm in a single protein (3H-labelled albumin) applied to the gel and the resulting peak area obtained from the densitometer scan, over the range 1000-65 000 dpm. The limit of detectability was about 500 dpm for a 1 week exposure. In the experiments described below, 5000-30 000 dpm were layered on the gel for each sample. Samples labelled via the metabolic incorporation of 3H-labelled amino acids and [14C]glucosamine were analyzed on polyacrylamide disc gels which were sectioned, and incorporated radioactivity determined [10] using a Packard Tri Carb liquid scintillation counter with automatic external standardization. Corrections for quenching and calculation of the specific dpm of 3H and 14 C in double label experiments were performed using a program developed for the Hewlett Packard programmable calculator. Apparent molecular weights of separated membrane components were estimated by comparison with a standard composed of 3H-labelled/~-galactoside- [15] (Escherichia coli), bovine albumin, ovalbumin and chymotrypsinogen, which was electrophoresed in parallel. Materials. Neuraminidase, free of protease activity, was obtained from Materials. Neuraminidase, free of protease activity, was obtained from Behringwerke. Galactose oxidase was secured from Sigma or Kabi, Sweden (this material was tested for protease activity and freed of such activity by heat treatment [16], if necessary). Tritiated borohydride (100Ci/M), [14C]glucosamine (45- 55 Ci/M), 3H-labelled amino acid mixture (l.0mCi/ml), and liquid scintillation supplies were obtained from New England Nuclear. Kodak RP/R14 X-ray film was obtained from Rutherford Scientific. Other chemicals were of reagent grade and were used as purchased. RESULTS Surface labelling patterns of wild type and drug-resistant cells As we have previously reported, the galactose oxidase-boro[3H]hydride labelling pattern of the surface membrane of wild type Chinese hamster ovary cells (AUX B1) consists of two major high molecular weight peaks of approx. 139 000 and 95 000-100 000, and a diffuse complex of smaller peaks in the range of 55 000- 65 000 (refs. 6, 10 and Fig. la). The labelling patterns of a number of colchicineresistant clones of increasing degrees of drug resistance (Table I) are shown in Figs. lb-d, respectively. It can be seen that the most striking feature of these patterns is the increased labelling of a high molecular weight component of approx. 170 000 1. Surface labelling of wild type and drug resistant Chinese hamster ovary clones. Clones AUX B1, CHRS42 H52, CHRA3 $5 and CHRC5S3 were surface labelled using the galactose oxidase-boro 13H]- hydride technique. Plasma membranes were prepared from the labelled cells and were analyzed by gel electrophoresis in the presence of 1 ~o sodium dodecyl sulfate and mercaptoethanol, followed by autoradiography. Approximately equal amounts of radioactivity (6700 dpm) were layered on the gel for each cell type. The autoradiograms were scanned in a recording densitometer. The acrylamide concentration was 7.5 ~o. Since equal amounts of radioactivity were applied for each cell type, in the pattern for CHaC5S3 where much of the label is associated with the 170 000 dalton peak, the other components appear reduced in magnitude. This is not the case, however, and d simply reflects the vast increase in the relative amount of labelled 170 000 dalton component, as compared to the other surface-labelled components. The component of apparent molecular weight greater than 200 000 is extremely labile and varies substantially in amount even between experiments on the same clone. Abscissa: apparent molecular weight in daltons. Ordinate: arbitrary units of absorbance (the Metabolic incorporation of carbohydrate and protein precursors The increased galactose oxidase-boro[aH]hydride-induced labelling of the P_ glycoprotein observed in our mutant lines (Fig. 1) could result from any one of several possible causes. For example, it could stem from changes in the membrane conformation of mutant cells, resulting in greater accessibility of the P glycoprotein [18], from alterations in the composition of the oligosaccharide side chains of the P component [9], or even from selective adsorption of material from the growth medium by mutant lines. Alternatively, the increased surface labelling of the P glycoprotein might result from the introduction of increased amounts of this glycoprotein into the mutant membranes via normal biosynthetic routes. We have attempted to discriminate among these possibilities by metabolic labelling studies, employing precursors to proteins (3H-labelled amino acids) and oligosaccharides ([14C]glucosamine) [11]. As can be seen in Fig. 2, the membrane components of a highly colchicine-resistant mutant, CHRC5S3 and of the parental Metabolic labelling of wild type and drug-resistant clones. Individual cultures of clones C5 $3 and AUX B1 were labelled by metabolic incorporation of 114C] glucosamine or of 3H-labelled amino acids and membranes were prepared from the labelled cells as described in Experimental Procedures. For each cell type, membranes labelled with 3H and with 1*C were pooled, dissolved in sodium dodecyl sulfate and analyzed by electrophoresis on a s~gle disc gel in the presence of 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate plus mercaptoethanol. The gels were sectioned and analyzed for radioactivity as described in Experimental Procedures. The vertical scales were chosen for convenience of display. The parameters of interest are the relative peak heights and not the absolute dpm values, since different amounts of material were layered on each gel. It should be noted that the prominent peak of molecular weight 200 000 is extremely labile and varies substantially from experiment to experiment within a single clone. Abscissa: molecular weight scale. Ordinate: dpm per gel slice. incorporation of isotopic precursors and that it is present in increased amounts relative to other membrane components in the mutant cells. To further substantiate that the new 170 000 dalton peak observed by metabolic labelling in mutant cells (Fig. 2) is identical with the P glycoprotein (Fig. 1), we have double-labelled the membrane carbohydrate of a highly colchicine-resistant mutant by metabolic incorporation of [~4C]glucosamine and by external labelling with galactose oxidase and NaB3H4 . Analysis of membranes from these cells demonstrates that the P glycoprotein component visualized by surface labelling coincides with that labelled via metabolic incorporation (data not shown). These results, taken with those described above, indicate that the primary cause of the increased galactose oxidase-induced labelling of P glycoprotein in drug-resistant clones is an increase in the relative amount of this particular class of cell surface glycoprotein in the membranes of mutant cells. Selective proteol ysis As a further test of the chemical nature and subcellular localization of the P glycoprotein, we determined whether or not labelled _P glycoprotein was affected when intact cells were treated by various proteases. As can be seen in Fig. 3, when highly resistant C5S3 cells are treated with proteases, subsequent to labelling with galactose oxidase-boro[3H]hydride, the amount of surface-labelled material in the range of 40 000-200 000 daltons is substantially reduced. This was the case when C5S3 cells were treated, either with pronase (100 #g/ml) or chymotrypsin (1.0 mg/ml). Since proteolytic dissection, as employed here, cleaves primarily cell surface polypeptides and does not affect intracellular components [10], the results from Fig. 3, provide evidence for a cell surface location for the 170 000 dalton component. Furthermore, the proteolytic susceptibility of the galactose oxidase-boro[aH]hydride-labelled material confirms that the components visualized by this surface label technique, including the P component, are glycoproteins, rather than another form of carbohydrate- containing molecule. The P glycoprotein, although reduced by proteolytic cleavage, seems to be more resistant to this process than some of the other membrane glycoproteins (e.g. the 200 000 dalton component). Presence of altered cell surface components in other drug-resistant accompanied by cell surface changes in other cell types. In this regard, we have examined the galactose oxidase-boro[3H]hydride-induced labelling patterns of wild type and actinomycin D-resistant clones from an SV40-transformed Syrian hamster line [19] isolated in another laboratory. This resistant variant also exhibits pleiotropic cross-resistance to other drugs. Both wild type and actinomycin D-resistant lines were recloned prior to surface labelling studies. As seen in Fig. 4, the galactose oxidase-induced labelling pattern of wild type SV40-transformed hamster cells is different from that of wild type CHO cells, with the two most prominent peaks having a lower apparent molecular weight (c.f. Fig. l a). However, as in the case of the Chinese hamster ovary system, the drug-resistant SV40-transformed ceils possess a large labelled peak of high molecular weight whichis not present in wild type cells (Fig. 4). Thus, the evidence suggests that, in hamster cells at least, a pleiotropic pattern of drug resistance is accompanied by an alteration in the array of cell surface glycoproteins. DISCUSSION The results presented here indicate that drug-resistant Chinese hamster ovary cells possess a component of high molecular weight, the _P glycoprotein, which is not readily detectable in the wild type cells (Figs. 1 and 2). Evidence for the glycoprotein nature and cell surface localization of this component includes the observations that the component is reactive with the galactose oxidase-boro[3H]hydride technique for labelling surface carbohydrates, that the component can be labelled by metabolic incorporation of precursors for either carbohydrates or proteins, and that the component can be cleaved by proteolytic digestion of intact cells under conditions where only cell surface peptides are attacked (Figs. 2 and 3). Evidence that the presence of the P glycoprotein is functionally related to the drugresistant phenotype, rather than due to clonal variation, differences in growth rates, or other adventitious effects, is in the form of a strong correlation between the relative amount of surface-labelled P glycoprotein and the degree of drug resistance (Table l). The correlation prevails in a number of independent clones where stepwise increases in resistance are accompanied by concomitant increases in the proportion of labelled P glycoprotein. This observation parallels the genetic characterization of the CH R phenotype, where the stepwise selection of mutants with increasing drug resistance seems to suggest the existence of multiple alleles controlling the degree of expression of a particular trait [2, 3]. The correlation also holds in drug-sensitive revertants which display a marked decrease in the relative amount ofP glycoprotein (c.f. Table I), as would be expected if the P glycoprotein were functionally related to the drugresistant phenotype. Moreover, a selective alteration of the surface glycoprotein pattern, similar to that seen in the Chinese hamster ovary system, has also been observed in a completely independent line (actinomycin D-resistant SV40-transformed Syrian hamster cells) (Fig. 4). These results suggest that the molecular basis for a pleiotropic drug-resistant phenotype may frequently be an alternation in the array of cell surface glycoproteins. However, at least one possible exception to this pattern (clone CHRS42HA) has been detected indicating the possibility of other mechanisms for the control of drug resistance. Our observations levels of _ glycoprotein are consistent with an earlier report [20] where drug-resistant cells were observed to display an increase in glycosyltransferase activity, adecrease in glycosidase activity and complex alterations of the membrane glycoproteins as visualized by periodic acid-Schiff staining. In contrast to the present report, however, only one resistant line was examined, a line which had originated by continuous selection in the presence of increasing amounts of drug [20, 21 ]. Thus, the complex changes observed may have been the end result of multiple genetic alterations. The pleotropic drug-resistant phenotype has a number of interesting features which when considered together suggest a model having pertinence to many areas of membrane biology. Some of these features are summarized below. (a) The mutation(s) leading to colchincine resistance also lead to a pattern of cross-resistance to other amphiphilic drugs, and the resistance is due, in all cases tested, to reduced drug permeation in the mutant cell types [2]. (b) Since the uptake kinetics for amphiphilic drugs suggest passive permeation [4, 5], and since degree of resistance to different agents appears to correlate to some extent with the hydrophobicity of the drugs [3], it seems likely that many amphiphilic drugs permeate into the cell via diffusion through hydrophobic regions of the plasma membrane. (c) However, the permeability of such regions must be under metabolic control, since the rate of drug uptake appears to be controlled in a reversible manner by the intracellular ATP levels [4]. These observations together with the present results concerning the presence of a novel surface glycoprotein in the resistant cells, are consistent with the following model. We propose that cell surface proteins, such as the "P_. glycoprotein", modulate the fluidity of the plasma membrane lipids, either globally or locally within restricted domains. Alterations of membrane lipid fluidity are reflected by changes in the permeation rate of drugs entering the cell via hydrophobic pathways [22]. The conformation and thus the function of the P-type proteins themselves are, in turn, influenced by cellular ATP levels, either directly or through the agency of as yet unidentified cytoplasmic components. Alternative explanations of the observed results might include the notion the P-type components provide a glycoprotein "fuzz" which screens the membrane, or that _P-type components bind and immobilize drugs at the cell surface and thus prevent their permeation; however, neither of these suggestions in tenable. If the entire cell surface were effectively screened by a glycoprotein mesh, then the permeation of all solutes should be reduced. However, this is not the case, since passively diffusing hydrophilic moieties such as erytkritol enter the mutant cells as readily as wild type cells [4]. The possibility that _P -type components specifically bind drugs also seems rather unlikely, since the mutant cells are simultaneously resistant to a number of structurally unrelated compounds, whose only common characteristic is their amphiphilic nature, as manifested by a relative high oil/water partition on a restricted membrane domain concerned with drug permeation, or whether they influence the overall state of the membrane lipid bilayer. If the latter were true, then P_-type glycoproteins might play a role in modulating the activity of those membrane enzymes, and transport systems which are susceptible to fluidity changes [2]. Thus, P-type glyeoproteins could serve as transducers, linking events at the cell surface to metabolic activity within the cell interior.

18	1973	ACTIVE OUTWARD TRANSPORT OF DAUNOMYCIN IN RESISTANT EHRLICH ASCITES TUMOR CELLS 	The mechanism of a previously reported decreased accumulation of daunomycin in resistant compared to wild-type Ehrlich ascites tumor cells was investigated in vitro. Several findings indicated an active extrusion of daunomycin from resistant cells: (1) Over a certain range of daunomycin concentrations, the accumulation was considerably higher in isolated nuclei from resistant cells than in the corresponding whole cells. (2) The distribution ratio at steady state of daunomycin in resistant whole cells to that in the medium increased with concentration, in contrast to a decrease for isolated resistant nuclei. (3) Accumulativn of daunomycin in re,dstant cells was enhanced by structural analogs (N-acetyldaunomycin and daunorubicinol) and by metabolic inhibitors (2-deoxyglucose and iodoacetate). In wild-type cells the accumulation of daunomycin was also increased by 2-deoxyglucose, suggesting an active extrusion of daunomycin from these cells too. The initial rate of net daunomycin uptake was lower in resistant than in wildtype cells, and the decreased accumulation in resistant cells may be due either to a higher rate of active efflux, a lower rate of influx (in the presence of active efflux), or both. The nuclear binding capacity for daunomycin was about the same in the two cell types. Vincristine and vinblastine increased the accumulation of daunomycin in resistant cells. Together with previous findings of reciprocal cross-resistance between daunomycin and the vinca alkaloids, and a decreased accumulation of daunomycin in cells selected for resistance to vincristine and vinblastine, this effect suggests that these drugs are transported by the same extrusion mechanism as daunomycin.   INTRODUCTION Daunomycin** is a cytotoxic antibiotic isolated from Streptomyces peucetius. It is an anthracycline, and the chemical constitution of the drug and of some related compounds used in this study is shown in Fig. 1. Daunomycin is an inhibitor of cellular synthesis of DNA and RNA 6'7, probably by binding to DNA by intercala-  Previously, resistance to daunomycin was developed in vivo in an originally sensitive strain of Ehrlich ascites tumor by treatment with the drug 16. The daunomycin-resistant tumor line showed cross-resistance to the antibiotic adriamycin z7 which is closely related to daunomycin (see Fig. 1). Furthermore, cross-resistance was found to the vinca alkaloids vincristine 16 and vinblastine z8 (Fig.l). The vinca alkaloids arrest mitosis during metaphase due to binding to microtubules, and the drugs play an important role in cancer chemotherapy ~9'2°. Sublines of the Ehrlich ascites tumor resistant to each of the drugs adriamycin, vincristine and vinblastine have also been obtained by treatment with the respective drugs, and reciprocal cross-resistance has been demonstrated between each of these drugs and daunomycin17, is. In vitro investigations on the inhibition of nucleic acid synthesis by daunomycin in wild-type and resistant Ehrlich ascites tumor cells were previously reported 7 and showed that approximately five times the concentration of daunomycin was needed to give the same degree of inhibition of DNA and RNA synthesis in resistant cells as in wild-type cells. One reason for this difference, but not the whole explanation, was that considerably less daunomycin was accumulated in resistant cells than in wild-type cells 7. The present study was undertaken to elucidate the mechanism of the decreased daunomycin accumulation in resistant cells. Several findings indicate that there is an active outward transport of daunomycin in resistant cells. It also appears that other anthracyclines and the vinca alkaloids are transported by the same mechanism. Abstracts on part of this study have been published  MATERIALS AND METHODS Tumor cells The cells investigated were Ehrlich mouse ascites tumor strain EHR 2 (ref. 16) and the corresponding resistant tumor lines EHR 2/DM + (ref. 16), EHR 2/ADR + (ref. 17), EHR 2/VCR+ (ref. 18), and EHR 2/VLB+ (ref. 18), in which resistance was developed and maintained in vivo by daunomycin, adriamycin, vincristine, and vinblastine, respectively. The tumors were propagated and ascitic fluid collected as described previously 7'16. No drug treatment was given to the resistant tumor lines in the last passage before the experiments. Drugs and isotopes Daunomycin, adriamycin, and [3H]daunomycin (16.6/~Ci/mg), all as hydrochlorides, and N-acetyldaunomycin, were kindly supplied by Farmitalia Co., Milan, Italy. The radiochemical purity of [3H]daunomycin was assayed by thin-layer --.*L -- J .... J~ ," • chromatography as desc, u~u below, and mu~¢ than-890/o of the ~auiuac,v~3r was found in the daunomycin spot. In experiments in which [an ]daunomycin was used in concentrations higher than 10 #g/ml, the specific activity was lowered by addition of unlabeled daunomycin. Daunorubicinol was a gift from Dr Nicholas Bachur, National Cancer Institute, Baltimore Cancer Research Center, Baltimore, U.S.A. Vincristine and vinblastine, both as sulphates, were obtained from Lilly Co., Minneapolis, U.S.A. 2-Deoxyglucose was supplied by B.D.H. Chemicals, Poole, England. Incubation Unless otherwise stated, incubation of cells was performed as described in detail previously 7 in a medium composed of 90% Earle's solution and 10°/0 calf serum, in a shaking incubator at 37 °C in atmospheric air with 5% CO2. The pH of the medium remained between 7.0 and 7.4 during the incubations. In all experiments (except those described in Fig. 9) the relative cell volume of the suspensions was 10/~1 packed cells/ml as determined by centrifugation in a hematocrit centrifuge. After incubation the suspensions were cooled to 0-4 °C and the cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 900 × g for 4 rain and washed twice with a 0.15 M NaCI solution, still at 0-4 °C. Nuclei Isolated nuclei were prepared by swelling of the cells in a hypotonic buffer  and homogenization with a close-fitting ball homogenizer as described previously 7. Using light microscopy the nuclei looked intact with varying but small amounts of cytoplasm attached. The preparations contained 1-3% apparently intact cells. DNA and RNA in cells and nuclei were determined as described 7. Preliminary experiments showed that there was a loss of 20-30% of the nuclei during preparation as judged by the DNA content. For comparison of uptake in nuclei and cells, nuclei were prepared from 1.2-1.3 times the amount of cells in corresponding cell suspensions. Incubation of nuclei was performed as described for cells. Determination of daunomycin The volume of supernatant medium and wash fluid was measured. After addition of one-tenth (v/v) 1.0 M HC1 the concentration of daunomycin was determined either by spectrophotometry at 480 nm or by spectrofluorimetry with a Zeiss PMQ II spectrophotometer with ZFM 4 fluoresence attachment (excitation 480 nm, emission 585 nm). In experiments with [aH]daunomycin the radioactivity was determined in a Beckman L 250 liquid scintillation spectrometer (100/~1 sample + 10 ml dioxanemethanol-naphthalene scintillation fluid). The possible influence of quenching was ruled out by using appropriate standard solutions of [all ]daunomycin. In all the determinations spectrophotometrically adjusted daunomycin standards were used, assuming E~°~ in methanol at 490 nm to be 218. The weight statements for daunomycin refer to the hydrochloride. In all cases the combined daunomycin content of the wash fluid was less than 5% of that of the medium. Calculation of daunomyein uptake in cells and nuclei In all experiments (except those shown in Fig. 9) daunomycin uptake was calculated by subtraction of the daunomycin content in medium and wash fluid from the amount added to the suspension. The uptake is stated as #g daunomycin/ml suspension. In experiments with cells (except those in Fig. 9) 1/ag/ml suspension = 100 #g/ml packed cells = 177 nmoles/ml packed cells.  Filter disc technique for rapid sampling In order to measure the rate of daunomycin uptake, cell suspensions were sucked through cellulose acetate filter discs (Millipore Corp., Mass., U.S.A.) 25 mm in diameter, with pore size 1/zm. This filter was chosen because of low adsorption of daunomycin and the adsorption was further reduced by pre-wetting the filters with the medium. Immediately after filtering the suspensions the filters were washed by sucking 25 ml 0.15 M NaC1 solution at 0-4 °C through them. Daunomycin was extracted from the cells retained on the filters by shaking for 15 rain in a mixture of 0.12 ml 7.5 M HC1 and 2.88 ml 96% (v/v) alcohol at 37 °C. The daunomycin concentration was determined spectrofluorimetrically. As blanks, extracts were used from filters through which medium with daunomycin but without cells had been sucked.   spectrophotometrically 7. However, several metabolites of daunomycin have been described which have absorption spectra almost identical with the drug itself: the quantitatively important ones being daunoumycin aglycone, daunorubicinol (Fig. 1), and daunorubicinol aglycone 23. To evaluate the possible role of metabolism in the uptake, daunomycin was extracted from cells and characterized by thin-layer chromatography using a modification of a technique which has been reported to separate daunomycin from these metabolites 24. Wild-type and daunomycin-resistant cells or isolated nuclei were incubated with [3H]daunomycin for 60 min. [3H]Daunomycin was extracted from cells and isolated nuclei by homogenization in chloroform-methanol (2:1, v/v), an equal volume of water was added, the emulsion was centrifuged, the organic phase collected and evaporated to dryness, the residue dissolved in a mixture (6:1, v/v) of an 0.02 M acetate buffer (pH 3.8) and n-butanol, and after centrifugation the n-butanol phase was removed. [3H]Daunomycin was extracted from medium and wash solutions with chloroform and processed as described for the cell extracts. All extractions were repeated 2~, times. The n-butanol solutions were used for thinlayer chromatography on silica gel plates with chloroform-methanol-acetic acid (80:20:4, by vol.) as the mobile phase. The daunomycin spot was localized under 366 nm light by comparison with spots obtained with the authentic compound. The spot was scraped from the plate and mixed with scintillation fluid. Radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry. The chromatogram remaining after the removal of the daunomycin spot was divided into portions and the radioactivity was determined as above. There were no major differences between the different preparations, either in recovery during extraction or in the chromatographic pattern of extracted [3H ]daunomycin. In all four cases 74-82~o of the radioactivity added to the suspensions was recovered in the butanol extract and after chromatography 85-89% of the radioactivity in the butanol was found in the daunomycin spot. (In parallel control chromatograms with authentic [3H]daunomycin, 89-92% of the radioactivity was found in the daunomycin spot.) This makes it unlikely that metabolism of daunomycin plays any major role in the cellular or nuclear uptake under the conditions used in the present study. In order to test whether, after incubation of resistant cells, daunomycin might be present in the medium in a conjugated form which was transported differently from daunomycin itself, resistant cells were incubated with daunomycin at 20 #g/ml for 60 min. Cells were pelleted and the supernatant was used for suspending wild RESULTS Uptake of daunomycin in various cell lines Fig. 2 shows the cellular uptake of daunomycin with time in different cell types when 10 Fg/ml is added at time zero. In all the cases a steady state is reached within 15-30 min. Daunomycin is highly concentrated in all the cell types, but less so in resistant than in wild-type cells. The mean cellular steady-state concentration of daunomycin, which was not washed out by two washings at 0 °C, was 810/~g/ml in wild-type cells compared to a concentration of 1.8 #g/ml in the surrounding medium (ratio 450); for the daunomycin-resistant cells the corresponding figures were 310/~g/ml and 6.8 #g/ml (ratio 46). The cells selected for resistance to adriamycin, vincristine, and vinblastine, which were cross-resistant to daunomycin 17'19, showed the same low degree of accumulation of daunomycin as cells selected by treatment with the drug itself. Steady-state level in isolated nuclei and whole cells Daunomycin is probably mainly bound to DNA in the nuclei 9'25. To study whether the difference in cellular uptake was due to a difference in nuclear binding capacity, whole cells and isolated nuclei were incubated with daunomycin and the uptake determined with time (Fig. 3). In all the cases the uptake of daunomycin reached a steady state within 15-30 min. Slightlyless daunomycin was taken up at steady state in the suspensions of resistant than of wild-type isolated nuclei. However, the DNA contents indicate that the yield was lower in the preparation of isolated nuclei from resistant cells, and calculated in relation to DNA content the uptake is a little higher in the suspension of resistant than of wild-type isolated nuclei. The daunomycin uptake in relation to DNA content cannot be taken as an absolute measure for the binding capacity as the daunomycin concentration in the medium at steady state is different in the  The uptake of daunomycin in isolated resistant nuclei was considerably higher than in the corresponding whole cells, despite the fact that the DNA content indicates that the number of isolated resistant nuclei was lower than the number of cells in the corresponding cellular suspension. This finding is in contrast to the daunomycin uptake in isolated wild-type nuclei which was slightly less than in the wild-type whole cells, despite the indication from the DNA content that in this case the number of nuclei in the suspension is higher than the number of cells in the corresponding cellular suspension. Fig. 4 shows the relation between the steady-state daunomycin concentration in the medium and the uptake of daunomycin in whole cells and isolated nuclei. At low daunomycin concentrations the uptake in wild-type nuclei is about the same as in whole cells, whereas at higher daunomycin concentrations more drug is taken up by whole cells than by nuclei. In resistant nuclei, however, more daunomycin is taken up than in the corresponding whole cells when tire steady-state concentration in the medium is below about 30/zg/ml, whereas at higher daunomycin concentrations the uptake is highest in whole cells. To evaluate whether the binding capacity of the resistant nuclei was lower in their natural intracellular milieu than when suspended in incubation medium, the binding of daunomycin to resistant nuclei was investigated in different media. (1) In 10% calf serum and 90% of the following solution: 71 mM Na +, 80 mM K ÷, 0.4 mM Mg 2'+, 58 mM CI-, 0.4 mM SO42-, 35 mM HPO42-, 28 mM H2PO4-, 5.5 mM glucose (pH 7.2-7.4 in presence of 5% CO2), a concentration of Na +, K +  istant cells at steady state is lower than in the medium. This cannot be explained solely by the existence of a passive diffusion barrier to daunomycin in the cell membrane. A diffusion barrier would influence the time of reaching equilibrium, but at equilibrium the electrochemical potential of daunomycin in the cytoplasm would be equal to that in the medium, and from electro However, the findings could be explained by an active outward transport of daunomycin in resistant cells. As a leak-pump system this outward transport would then at steady state be in equilibrium with an inward transport, which might be carrier-mediated transport, simple diffusion, or both. The shape of the graphs in Fig. 4 supports this hypothesis. In contrast to the findings for wild-type whole cells and isolated nuclei, and resistant isolated nuclei, the graph for resistant whole cells is convex downward, implying that the distribution ratio of daunomycin in resistant cells to that in the medium increased with concentration. Effect of anthracyclines and vinca alkaloids on accumulation of daunomycin Competitive inhibitors may provide the opportunity for verifying that a carriermediated extrusion is present in resistant cells, as inhibition of an active extrusion of daunomycin in resistant cells would cause an increase in the cellular steady-state level of the drug.  Possible competitive inhibitors of daunomycin transport would be structurally related compounds such as adriamycin, daunorubicinol, and N-acetyldaunomycin, a derivative of daunomycin with low affinity to DNA (ref. 9) (Fig. 1). Although the chemical structures are different (see Fig. 1), other possible competitive compounds would be the vinca alkaloids vincristine and vinblastine, because of the common mechanism of uptake, suggested by the reciprocal cross-resistance between these drugs and daunomycin 16'1s, and by the decreased uptake of daunomycin in cells with resistance developed to vinca alkaloids (Fig. 2). Experiments were performed as shown in Fig. 5 with measurement of the effect of the above mentioned compounds on uptake of [3H]daunomycin in resistant cells. Vinblastine, N-acetyldaunomycin, vincristine, and daunorubicinol all caused an increase of varying degree in the accumulation of [3H ]daunomycin at steady state in resistant cells; vinblastine being most effective and daunorubicinol least effective. On the other hand adriamycin caused a decrease in the steady-state level of [3H]- daunomycin. The effect of vincristine on the accumulation of [3H ]daunomycin at steady state was investigated at different concentrations of daunomycin. The results are shown in Fig. 6. In resistant cells, vincristine at 30/zg/ml increased the steady-state level  with increased daunomycin concentrations, and with an initial daunomyein concentration at 100/~#aal which gave a steady-~tate con~ntration in-the medium at about 60/,g/ml, there was almost no effect of vincristine 30/,g/ml on the cellular steady-state level of daunomycin. These findings are compatible with a competitive inhibition by vincristine of an active saturable outward daunomycin transport, and support the hypothesis that anthracyclines and vinca alkaloids share the same transport system. The different effectiveness of daunorubicinol, N-acetyldaunomycin, vincristine and vinblastine in increasing uptake of [3H]daunomycin may reflect differences in affinity to the outward transport mechanism. The decrease in steady-state level of [aH]daunomycin caused by adriamycin does not exclude that adriamycin is transported by the same transport system as daunomycin, but may sagos_ t that also the inward transport of daunomyein is carrier-mediated (but not uphill). The effect of adriamycin on the daunomycin-pump might then be an example of competitive acceleration as discussed by Rosenberg and Wilbrandt 29. The effect of several other compounds on the steady-state level of [all ]daunomycin in resistant cells was investigated under conditions identical to those described in Fig. 5: tetracycline chloride, streptomycin sulphate, colchicine, atropine sulphate, ethylmorphine, allantoin, urea, fl-alanine and caffeine. At a concentration of 30/zg/ml none of these compounds affected the steady-state level of [3H]- daunomycin. This suggests that the hypothetical extrusion mechanism is rather specific, in spite of the indications that it transports such chemically different compounds as anthracyclines and vinca alkaloids. An alternative explanation for the increased daunomycin uptake induced byN-acetyldaunomycin, daunorubicinol, and vinca alkaloids is damage to the cell membrane, increasing the leakage of daunomycin and thus diminishing the concentration gradient maintained by an active outward transport. Another explanation would be that the   resistant cells. An explanation which does not imply an active extrusion of daunomycin is that the compounds increase the intracellular binding capacity for daunomycin. Experiments similar to those in Fig. 5 were therefore performed with suspensions of nuclei from resistant cells, but no effect on the daunomycin uptake in nuclei was found, either with N-acetyldaunomycin and daunorubicinol or with the vinca alkaloids. This result does not exclude that the drugs affect the binding capacity of the nuclei in situ, but makes it unlikely. It should be noted that all the alternative explanations require that these effects are caused by N-acetyldaunomycin, daunorubicinol, and the vinca alkaloids, but not by the above mentioned compounds which did not affect the daunomycin uptake. Effect of metabolic inhibitors on accumulation of daunon~yein 2-Deoxyglucose was found to increase the accumulation of dannomycin considerably in resistant cells which were preincubated in a medium where glucose and phosphate were omitted from Earle's solution (Fig. 7). Control resistant cells in-  also be applied in the case of the action of 2-deoxyglucose and iodoacetate. In wild-type cells it was found (Fig. 6) that 2-deoxyglucose caused a considerable increase in the steady-state level of daunomycin, while a small, but repeated increase in the daunomycin level was seen with vincristine. This suggests that there is an active extrusion of daunomycin also from these cells. The steady-state level of daunomycin in 2-deoxyglucose-poisoned cells may be taken as a measure of the intracellular binding capacity for daunomycin, and Fig. 6 then shows that the intracellular binding capacity of daunomycin-resistant cells is about the same as that of the same packed volume of wild-type cells.  Rate of daunomycin elution The rate of elution of daunomycin from resistant cells was measured in experiments (not shown) where the cells were incubated at 37 °C with daunomycin, pelleted by centrifugation and transferred to medium without daunomycin. There was an increase in the concentration of daunomycin in the medium which was linear for 5 min. However, when similar experiments were performed with nuclei, the rate of elution was of the same order of magnitude. It could not be excluded that the ratelimiting process measured by elution from whole cells was the release from the nuclei. Therefore the system is not suitable for direct studies of the extrusion of daunomycin. Rate of daunomycin uptake The rate of uptake of daunomycin was determined in experiments where the cells for rapid sampling were collected on filter discs. In order to keep the fall of the daunomycin concentration in the medium at a minimum during the sampling period, the cells were incubated in suspension with a cell density (1 /tl/ml) which was one-tenth of the usual. Results in Fig. 9 (inset) show that the uptake was finear with time for 5 min, and the slope of this line was taken as the rate of uptake. The uptake curves do not pass through the point of origin. This can partly be due to trapping of medium between the ceUs andthe filter, but this cannot exptain the whol~ difference. These findings suggest that before the linear phase of uptake there is a phase of-rapid bindingofdaunomycin, which has been completed within 15 s. The experiments were performed with initial daunomycin concentrations between 0.2 and 10/zg/ml, and in this range the rate of uptake was directly proportional to the  daunomycin concentration for both wild-type and daunomycin-resistant cells; the rate being more than three times higher for wild-type than for resistant cells. With rates of daunomycin uptake as calculated, the mean overall intracellular daunomycin concentration reached the extracellular concentration in 3 s in wildtype cells and in 10 s in resistant cells. This raises the questions whether the ratelimiting process in the daunomycin uptake is the membrane transport or the binding in the nuclei and whether during the period of measurement there is an outward flow of daunomycin, so that the rate of net uptake measured is smaller than the influx. The lower uptake in resistant cells despite the indications that the intracellular binding capacity is as high as in the wild-type cells (Fig. 6), argues for the membrane transport being rate limiting in resistant cells. The linearity of the uptake with time argues for the efflux in both cell types being negligible in the first 5 min. A final answer to these questions requires further investigations. Provided that the membrane transport is rate limiting for daunomycin uptake, that the net flux is equal to the influx, and that the cytoplasmic concentration of free daunomycin is practically zero during the first 5 min, then the linearity of the uptake rate with increasing concentration in the medium is in agreement both with a diffusion mechanism of the inflow, and with a carrier mechanism in which the carrier is well below saturation within the investigated range of concentrations. With the assumption that outward flow in resistant ceils is negligible in the first 5 min, it is further indicated that the inward permeability to daunomycin of resistant cells is lower that that of wild-type ceils.  Several findings on the steady-state level of daunomycin support the tentative conclusion that in resistant cells there is an outward flow of daunomycin which is against an electrochemical gradient, carrier mediated, and dependent on the energy metabolism. These are: (1) Over a certain range of daunomycin concentrations, the accumulation was considerably higher in isolated nuclei from resistant cells than in the corresponding whole cells (Figs 2 and 3). (2) The distribution ratio of daunomycin in resistant whole cells to that in the medium, increased with concentration, in contrast to a decrease for isolated resistant nuclei (Fig. 3). (3) Accumulation of daunomycin in resistant cells was enhanced by some structural analogs (Fig. 5) and by metabolic inhibitors (Figs 6 and 7). It should be noted that the supposed daunomycin-pump may be localized not only in the cell membrane but also in the nuclear membrane. If this is the case, the pump may be impaired in the isolated nuclei, because they are deprived of their energy supply. In wild-type cells an active extrusion of daunomycin may be indicated by an increase in accumulation of daunomycin by 2-deoxyglucose treatment (Fig. 6), but the influence of a hypothetical daunomycin extrusion is much less pronounced in wild-type cells. Data on the daunomycin uptake in 2-deoxyglucose-poisoned cells indicate that the intracellular binding capacity is about the same in wild-type and resistant cells (Fig. 6). The rate of net daunomycin uptake during the first 5 min was lower in resistant than in wild-type cells, suggesting a lower influx (Fig. 9). Thus the lower accumulation in resistant compared to wild-type cells may be due either to a higher efficiency of the active daunomycin extrusion, a decreased influx (in presence of active extrusion), or both. A linear increase of the rate of daunomycin uptake with concentration (Fig, 9) suggests that daunomycin influx is either diffusion or carrier mediated with a carrier which is not saturated at 10 #g/ml. The steady-state level of daunomycin in resistant cells decreased slightly with temperature (Fig. 8), combined with the indications of carrier-mediated effiux this suggests that influx is either carrier mediated or the result of diffusion with high degree of temperature dependence. A decrease in accumulation of daunomycin by adriamycin (Fig. 5) argues for the daunomycin influx being carrier mediated. Vincristine and vinblastine increased the steady-state level of daunornycin in resistant cells (Figs 5 and 6), suggesting that these drugs are transported by the same active extrusion mechanism as daunomycin. The hypothesis of a common transport mechanism for daunomycin and the vinca alkaloids is supported by reciprocal cross-resistance between these drugs 16'1s and by the decreased uptake of daunomycin in cells selected for resistance to vincristine and to vinblastine (Fig. 2). Similarly, it was suggested that N-acetyldaunomycin and daunorubicinol are transported by the daunomycin-pump (Fig. 5). Adriamycin decreased the daunomycin accumulation, but reciprocal cross-resistance between daunomycin and adria-  6. Active extrusion has not been proposed as the mechanism of decreased drug uptake in resistant cells in any of the cited cases, but might well appear to play a role in some of these systems. The increase in daunomycin uptake in resistant Ehrlich cells achieved by structural analogs implies possibilities of reversing that part of the resistance which is due to decreased drug uptake, by treatment with daunomycin in combination with such analogs. However, the therapeutic value of combination treatment may be limited by toxicity" even if the analog itself is atoxic in the necessary concentration, it may enhance the toxicity of daunomycin by increasing the uptake also in normal cells, should these also have an active extrusion of daunomycin. Furthermore, it has been found previously that in Ehrlich ascites tumor cells, decreased uptake is only one of several factors in the mechanism of resistance to daunomycin 7. The selective effect of daunomycin on malignant cells might possibly be related to the existence of a daunomycin pump which is more effective in normal than in some malignant cells, and exploration of this and of the efficiency of this	KELD DANO*
19	2018	The challenge of drug resistance in cancer treatment: a current overview	Abstract It is generally accepted that recent advances in anticancer agents have contributed significantly to the improvement of both the disease-free survival and quality of life in cancer patients. However, in many instances, a favorable initial response to treatment changes afterwards, thereby leading to cancer relapse and recurrence. This phenomenon of acquired resistance to therapy, it is a major problem for totally efficient anticancer therapy. The failure to obtain an initial response reflects a form of intrinsic resistance. Specific cell membrane transporter proteins are implicated in intrinsic drug resistance by altering drug transport and pumping drugs out of the tumor cells. Moreover, the gradual acquisition of specific genetic and epigenetic abnormalities in cancer cells could contribute greatly to acquired drug resistance. A critical issue in the clinical setting, is that the problem of drug resistance appears to have a negative effect on also the new molecularly-targeted anticancer drugs. Several ongoing efforts are being made by the medical community aimed to the identification of such resistance mechanisms and the development of novel drugs that could overcome them. In this review, the major drug resistance mechanisms and strategies to overcome them are critically discussed, and also possible future directions are suggested.  Introduction Drug resistance can be defined as the decrease in the efficacy and potency of a drug to produce therapeutic merits and represents a major impediment to the disease treatment and overall patient survival. Of note, resistance to anticancer treatments can be manifested by local or loco-regional, as well as distant tumor metastases leading in the paradox of therapy-induced metastasis (TIM) [1–3]. In many cases, tumors such as renal cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma and malignant melanoma often exhibit intrinsic resistance to chemotherapy, without prior exposure to anticancer agents, so the initial response to treatment is poor [1]. In other settings, the initial optimism after good treatment response is often followed by poor results and a devastating outcome, as tumors initially sensitive to therapy, later become unresponsive due to development of acquired drug resistance. Currently, surgery and/or radiotherapy represent the optimal treatment modalities for the management of localized tumors. Systemic treatments are required for hematologic malignancies or metastatic tumors. Current forms of systemic treatment are chemotherapy, immunotherapy and antiangiogenic agents [ The interaction between the drug and the tumor microenvironment is a complex phenomenon. Cancers have the ability to develop remarkable resistance to various treatments which target different molecular pathways [6]. Recent evidence suggests that radio- or chemotherapy for breast cancer result in a stem cell-like phenotype in non-stem tumor cells. Therefore, as it has also been suggested by a recent extensive meta-analysis, there is an urgent need to identify basic factors that determine drug resistance in cancer stem cells [7]. Of particular note, several lines of evidence have demonstrated that chemotherapy can potentially increase the levels of circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) that promote tumor growth and metastasis [3, 8]. In the “new era of targeted chemotherapy”, molecules and metabolic pathways implicated specifically in the growth and proliferation of cancer cells are blocked using molecularly- targeted drugs e.g., imatinib (Gleevec) which specifically targets BCR-ABL in chronic myeloid leukemia, aiming at achieving maximum treatment response and minimum toxicity compared to other types of cancer treatment. Of importance, the more targeted a drug is, the lower the probability to elicit drug resistance [9]. The largely quantitative difference between the conventional and the molecularlytargeted drugs, that provides some therapeutic margin, is that the targets of the former are mainly cellular (e.g., cell proliferation and DNA replication) or components (e.g., microtubules, topoisomerases) that are both in normal and cancer cells [10]. As a result, the molecularly-targeted drugs are less toxic than the conventional drugs, and they achieve effective treatment at remarkably lower doses than the maximum tolerated dose [11]. However, both types of drugs (i.e., conventional and molecularly-targeted) suffer from the problem of intrinsic and acquired drug resistance [12]. In the present review, the main factors that contribute to a compromized effectiveness of systemic anticancer drug regimens, as well as the potential mechanisms underlying drug resistance, are discussed. Intrinsic and acquired drug resistance Drug resistance may arise due to intrinsic and/or acquired factors. Intrinsic resistance can be attributed to: (a) drug breakdown, (b) altered expression and/or function of the drug target, (c) altered drug transport across the cellular membrane or (d) reduced interaction efficiency between the drug and its molecular target [4, 5]. Intrinsic cellular resistance can be mediated through ATP-dependent membrane transporters or nuclear receptors, e.g. sxr [14]. In addition, cellular metabolic processes, such as ceramide glycosylation decrease efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents [15] Also, cell cycle regulators and DNA damage repair factors enhance cross-drug resistance, by inhibiting drug accumulation, reducing influx, increasing efflux through cell membrane transporters, or inactivating drugs [9, 16]. Of interest, inactivation of tumor-associated genes including the tumor suppressor gene TP53 has been shown to result in resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs [17]. On the other hand, acquired drug resistance is influenced by genetic or environmental factors that facilitate the development of drug-resistant cancer cell clones or induce mutations of enzymes involved in relevant metabolic pathways [1, 5]. Genetic determinants of acquired drug resistance Genetic instability in the form of aneuploidy, deletions, point mutations, chromosomal translocations and gene amplifications is a key factor in several aspects of cancer pathogenesis [18], including intratumor heterogeneity, which fosters primary cancers, distant metastatic lesions and cancer relapse after therapeutic failure [19, 20]. Mathematical and computational models indicate a positive correlation between chemotherapeutic resistance and the number of spontaneous genetic mutations [21, 22], which can be utilized in adjusting the administered dose or determining the type of administered treatment [23, 24]. Other models used paradigm prokaryotic organisms, such as Escherichia coli, in an effort to detect mutations in drugresistant cancer cells and investigate their role in drug resistance [25–31]. These studies demonstrated that drug resistance usually results in a pattern of random mutations rather than a drug-specific effect [32–35]. Overall, resistance to drugs is directly dependent on the stability of the genetic material of the tumor cells and the level of genomic instability, the mechanism(s) of action of a chemotherapeutic drug, the dose of the administered drug and the treatment intervals [21, 22, 24]. Alterations in the genetic material such as inactive mutations may occur either before or during treatment, in small subpopulations of cancer cells. It is also possible that cancers intrinsically sensitive to chemotherapy contain at least one drug-resistant cell clone, expansion of which leads to acquired resistance and possibly recurrence. Therefore, combinatorial drug therapy provides a powerful rationale for reducing the likelihood of the development of multiple resistant clones, especially for patients undergoing adjuvant anticancer therapy with micrometastases and low-tumor burdens [36, 37]. There is an increasing interest in studying cancer clonal cell subpopulations and the evolution of resistant variants [38–40]. These studies demonstrate an intratumor heterogeneity and changes in the distribution of clonal subpopulations following treatment administration Epigenetic determinants of acquired drug resistance Epigenetic factors, such as DNA methylation and chromatinremodeling, contribute greatly to drug tolerance [43–45]. Zeller at al. [46] identified a series of genes that exhibited promoter hypermethylation in the cisplatin resistant ovarian cancer cells compared to their drug sensitive counterparts. Given that hypermethylation of gene promoters can be associated with transcriptional gene silencing [47], demethylation of several of these genes led to gene re-activation and restored chemosensitivity in cancer cells. In another study by Bhatla et al. [48], inhibition of histone deacetylation and DNA methylation resulted in the activation of genes preferentially methylated and repressed in relapsed pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia and drug sensitivity. Of importance, targeting of DNA methyltransferases effectors of DNA methylation and histone modification was found to reverse chemoresistance in heterogeneous multiple myeloma [49]. Intrinsic drug resistance‑associated membrane proteins Multidrug resistance (MDR) is largely dependent on the activity of membrane transporter proteins, referred to as “drug resistance-associated membrane proteins” or “DRAMPs” which act either directly by extruding drug molecules out of cells to reduce intracellular accumulation, or indirectly by affecting net accumulation of drugs through physico-chemical processes [4, 50]. Two major classes of DRAMPs have been identified: (i) the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily, which pumps hydrophobic chemotherapeutic drugs out of tumor cells thereby reducing the net intracellular accumulation and thus the efficacy of the drugs into tumor cells, and (ii) the solute carrier transporters which increase chemoresistance by interfering with the cellular uptake of hydrophilic anticancer agents [4, 50]. Approximately, 50 ABC transporters have been identified in the human genome which catalyze the active transport of diverse chemical compounds including anticancer drugs in an ATP-dependent way by a pair of cytoplasmic nucleotide-binding domains (NBD) [51]. There are three broad groups of ABC transporters implicated in MDR, namely, P-glycoprotein, ABCG2, and the multidrug resistance-associated proteins (MRPs) [50, 52] discussed below. P‑glycoprotein Overexpression of the protein P-glycoprotein (or ABCB1/ MDR1), an ATP-dependent efflux pump, results to MDR in several types of cancer (e.g., multiple myeloma, leukemia) [53–56], through the active translocation of drug molecules out of the tumor cells [50, 57]. The final prognosis in epithelial and solid tumors, as well as in blood malignancies, was particularly unfavorable due to enhanced ABCB1 efflux potential [58–60]. ABCB1 overexpression has been demonstrated in cases of chemotherapeutic failure [59–63]. Moreover, a high level of ABCB1 gene amplification was observed in MDR murine melanoma cells [64]. P-glycoprotein exhibits a very broad substrate specificity, including anthracyclines, vinca alkaloids, or taxanes, epipodophyllotoxins, which is the biochemical basis for its “MDR” property [65]. MDR‑associated protein The MDR-associated proteins (MRPs) constitute a group of 13 members, including MRP1 (ABCC1) [50, 52]. MRP1 overexpression was shown to result to resistance to anticancer agents. The presence of reduced glutathione (GSH) is a prerequisite for the transport of unmodified chemotherapeutic agents via MRP1 [66]. A peptidomimetic glutathioneconjugate of ethacrynic acid (EA), GS-EA, was found to inhibit MRP1-mediated efflux of drugs in ovarian cancer cells which display overexpression of MRP1. In addition, resistance of these cells to methotrexate was reversed in part [67]. ABCG2 Another member of the broad ABC superfamily, ABCG2, was overexpressed in human-derived breast cancer cells resistant to adriamycin [68]. Furthermore, it has been reported that hypoxia can regulate ABCG2 expression. Stem cells or cancer cells in hypoxic environment exhibit resistance to drugs due to enhanced ABCG2 expression [69]. ABCG2 is responsible for cell resistance to many anticancer drugs, with camptothecins being the most prominent example [70, 71]. However, FL118, a camptothecin analogue, was able to overcome effectively ABCG2-induced resistance [72]. The substrates of ABCG2 include many molecularly targeted chemotherapy drugs, such as Gefitinib an inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and Imatinib. However, its importance in clinical practice remains to be investigated. Classic chemotherapeutic drugs Methotrexate is an anticancer molecularly-targeted cytostatic drug, used either alone or in combination with other agents, to treat a variety of malignancies such as breast, lung, skin, and head and neck cancer. It is also used for the treatment of severe rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. Methotrexate exerts its anticancer effect through inhibiting the expression of its biochemical target dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), a key enzyme in DNA synthesis, which facilitates cancer cell growth and proliferation.

In methotrexate- resistant cancer cells, increased DHFR gene copies were identified [41]. Some anticancer agents, such as vinca alkaloids and taxanes prevent cell division through altering the dynamic instability of microtubules [73]. Taxanes have been successfully used as anticancer agents over the last 25 years by destabilizing microtubules; whereas, vinca alkaloids are implicated in the inhibition of microtubule function. The synergistic effect of these agents was tested experimentally and it was observed that their microtubule-specific activity was enhanced [74]. Resistance against the taxane paclitaxel was exerted by β III-tubulin isoforms [75]. In several types of epithelial tumors, βIII-tubulin expression was linked to poor response toward paclitaxel treatment and overall patient outcome [76]. Of particular note, an initial favorable clinical response was followed by resistance to taxane treatment. This could be explained by a gradual change in microtubule dynamics and functionality [77]. Particularly, the microtubule-associated protein (MAP)-Tau interferes with the binding of taxanes to microtubules. Down regulation of MAP-Tau was shown to lead to alteration of cancer cells’ chemosensitivity, rendering them more vulnerable to paclitaxel [78]. Anticancer drugs like camptothecin and epipodophyllotoxin target key enzymes involved in DNA replication and transcription such as topoisomerases. Camptothecin is a cytotoxic alkaloid administered to patients with leukemia [79, 80]. Experimental studies show that resistance to camptothecin and treatment failure are due to the activity of the enzyme topoisomerase type I [81]. Moreover, overexpression of topoisomerases type II was associated with altered efficacy of molecularly-targeted drugs [82, 83], such as Adriamycin, in chemoresistant leukemia cell lines [80]. Genetic alterations, such as mutations, in molecular drug targets like genes or proteins contribute greatly to acquired drug resistance, thereby leading to limited effectiveness or complete ineffectiveness of chemotherapy, mainly in advanced cancers [65]. For instance, Bcr-Abl kinase domain point mutations could impair or abolish imatinib binding in chemoresistant patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) [84, 85]. DNA damage repair Important determinants of response to many chemotherapy drugs and targeted therapies represent the DNA damage repair (DDR) pathways which include a complex of proteins, like Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER) machinery that processes and removes the so-called bulky lesions, such as those induced by UV light (thymine dimers and 6,4-photoproducts) and chemotherapeutic drugs such as cisplatin [86]. Two sub-pathways are involved in NER: the global genomic NER (GG-NER or GGR) which repairs DNA damage in transcriptionally silent loci and the transcription-coupled NER (TC-NER or TCR) which repairs lesions located in the transcriptionally active DNA regions. The NER pathway consists of some basic steps, including the identification of DNA damage, DNA unfolding, and other processes such as incision, polymerization, degradation, and ligation [87]. One of the most important genes related to NER is ERCC1, overexpression of which is usually associated with DDR induced by platinum and alkylating agent-based treatment and is correlated with negative outcomes in patients receiving cisplatin-based treatment in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [88]. DNA damage caused by platinum-based drugs can also be recognized by specific proteins, such as mismatch repair (MMR) complexes, thereby resulting to transduction of DNA damage signals and various downstream effectors [89]. In addition, the DNA damage repair protein O6- methylguanyl DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) is associated with resistance to chemotherapy with DNA alkylating anticancer drugs, such as nitrosoureas, carmustine and temozolomide in central nervous system tumors [87, 90]. The crosstalk and the signals generated between the effector molecules involved in DDR lead to either cell death or cell survival. One very important effector is the wellknown TP53 gene which triggers a major tumor abrogation mechanism via primarily the initiation of cell death, and plays a cardinal role in carcinogenesis when mutated [91]. If DNA damage is extensive and impossible to be repaired, then the apoptotic pathway becomes activated [17]. Moreover, DNA damage can result in apoptosis through the TP73 gene, a TP53-related gene [89]. There is a close relationship between oncogenesis and drug resistance/sensitivity modulated by a pathway dependent on TP53, mutations of which are detected in many human cancers [92, 93]. Cancer stem cells have stem-like properties and they exhibit higher resistant to chemotherapy in contrast to the differentiated tumor cells. Factors that affect CSCs’ resistance to drugs include: (a) induction of pathways implicated in stem cell maintenance; (b) activation and elevated expression of ABC transporter proteins (e. g., ABCB1 and ABCG2); (c) overexpression of detoxification enzymes such as certain aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) isoforms; (d) inhibition of apoptotic pathways, like the ones mediated by the proapoptotic TP53; (e) enhanced DNA damage repair capacity, thereby reducing the effectiveness of DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic agents; and (f) increased influence of the tumor microenvironmental niche [ Cancer microenvironment The cellular environment can affect greatly drug response, where the cell kinetic parameters and proliferation rate constitute important determinants of therapeutic effectiveness. Anticancer drugs and new biological agents that target these determinants have been shown to exert their antineoplastic effect by tranquilizing cancer cells [95]. Increased treatment effectiveness is usually achieved by targeting rapidly proliferating cancer cells [96]. According to a study by Hirst and Denekamp, the most effective chemotherapies are those that rapidly neutralize highly proliferating cells or selectively affect cell division [97]. Different treatments are required in the hypoxic regions of tumors or in regions with slow cell proliferation. Combination therapies with more than one anticancer agents do not necessarily guarantee treatment success because a drug can counteract or overlap the effect of another drug so that the combined effect is lower than predicted. There is a positive correlation between tumor cell proliferation and tumor vasculature, which ensures continuous blood supply to the growing tumor cells, as well as vascular permeability [97]. Reduced blood flow leads to deprivation of nutrients essential for the increased energy demands of the cell in the proliferation phase, thereby leading to delay or inhibition of proliferation. The slow cell proliferation and the poor blood supply are associated with potential resistance to molecularly-targeted drugs [98]. Novel chemosensitizing agents have been developed to counteract the phenomenon of resistance to many molecularly- targeted drugs [99]. Cell adhesion, cytokine activity, growth factors, cell proximity, oxygen and energy supply to the cells, as well as other factors, are suggested to be implicated in reduced anticancer drug response, decreased chemotherapeutic effectiveness and subsequent rapid tumor recurrence [100, 101]. Another factor which regulates the accumulation of oxygen to tumor cells is the hypoxia- inducible factor 1 (HIF1), a transcription factor [102]. HIF-1 promotes the activation of genes implicated in hypoxia signaling and inhibition of cell proliferation. HIF-1 is also implicated in the intracellular metabolism, pH regulation, inhibition of autophagy and cell death [102]. Oxygen deficiency was shown to be associated with the activation of genes encoding proteins that induce resistance to anticancer drugs, such as P-glycoprotein, especially in solid tumors [103]. Specific anticancer drugs can inhibit oxygen supply, allowing cancer cells to enter a dormant state [104]. Cells that survive drug treatment may potentially proliferate under hypoxic conditions, leading to tumor relapse in a short span of time. Additionally, the sufficient oxygenation of normal tissues is important in the mobility of anticancer drugs and favorable response to drug treatment [105]. Therefore, low oxygen concentration in tumor tissues is linked to low activity of anticancer drugs, poor tumor response to chemotherapy or rapid tumor relapse [106]. The cytotoxicity of anticancer drugs is largely affected by the pH of the tumor microenvironment. Molecules passively diffuse across the cell membrane, more effectively in the uncharged (non-ionized) form. Accordingly, alkalization of the extracellular environment increases the uptake and cytotoxicity of drugs such as Doxorubicin, with a pKa value of almost 9 [107, 108]. On the other hand, a microenvironment with acidic pH can also inhibit the active transport of certain drugs (e.g., methotrexate) [109]. Drug uptake and drug activation Plasma membrane proteins play a very important role in intrinsic drug sensitivity or resistance, given that antineoplastic drug molecules may be expelled from cancer cells either through passive diffusion or facilitated diffusion mediated by membrane proteins [110]. The majority of antimetabolite drugs need metabolic activation to produce therapeutically effective nucleotides or nucleosides intracellularly through the activity of phosphoribosyl transferases and kinases [111]. Another component of the redistribution of anticancer drugs is the binding of drug molecules to specific intracellular proteins [112]. In blood malignancies, these proteins have been found to largely contribute to significant drug resistance and treatment failure. For example, overexpression of a major vault protein, LRP, was observed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients [113]. Moreover, changes in intracellular chemical processes affect drug kinetics, leading to treatment failure [114]. Moses Judah Folkman proved first that angiogenesis and cancer are closely related [118]. Drug molecules are delivered to the target tumor cells through blood vessels. Abnormal vasculature and ultimately necrosis largely affect drug penetration and effectiveness [119, 120]. Currently, there is a number of chemotherapeutic drugs targeting the potent angiogenic factor, vascular epithelial growth factor (VEGF), such as Bevacizumab, Aflibercept, Pazopanib, Sunitinib and Sorafenib. The drugs normalize tumor vasculature, in order to increase the distribution of anticancer agents and achieve maximum therapeutic efficacy [121]. Moreover, the various physical barriers, such as the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and the blood-testis barriers, prevent the diffusion of chemotherapeutic drugs. Of note, overexpression of P-glycoprotein was observed in the endothelial cells of these barriers [122]. Strategies to overcome resistance mechanisms Many factors and parameters must be taken into consideration for the effective cancer treatment using antineoplastic drugs. Clinicians are mainly concerned with the route of drug administration as well as the maximum tolerated dose able to destroy cancer cells while minimizing adverse effects [115]. The “maximum tolerated dose”, also called “maximum tolerable dose” or the “maximally tolerated dose” (MTD), can be defined as the highest single dose of an agent or treatment that does not cause significant or intolerable toxicity/adverse effects. For many drugs, the optimal dose does not necessarily coincide with the MTD; thus, determination of the optimal dose poses a great challenge [116, 117]. A novel, promising modality of drug administration has emerged, the so-called ‘metronomic chemotherapy’, that is, the repetitive administration of chemotherapeutic agents at low doses. It has been demonstrated that metronomic chemotherapy can be extremely beneficial in many cases; however, extended research is needed to confirm these results [124, 125]. One therapeutic strategy to overcome drug resistance is ‘treatment holiday’, where a patient’s chemotherapy treatment is stopped for some time in order to avoid selection for drug-resistant tumor cells that could lead to cancer recurrence and relapse [115]. Of importance, special emphasis should be given to the development and optimization of molecularly-targeted drugs designed to block key genes or gene products implicated in chemoresistance. For example, resistance to chemotherapy caused by P-glycoprotein can be potentially counteracted by adding to a chemotherapy regimen the molecularly-targeted drug verapamil, a candidate competitive inhibitor of P-glycoprotein [54, 56, 126]. Moreover, a positive correlation was observed between cytidine deaminase activity in blast cells obtained from acute leukemia patients and the development of resistance to the antimetabolite drug cytosine arabinoside (ara-C) [114]. Therefore, an effective way of blocking the deamination of ara-C would circumvent resistance to ara-C. Other potential future directions The apparent complexity of cancer drug resistance, as discussed throughout the manuscript, leads to the suggestion that there is a pressing need for the design of novel therapeutic regimens. Unraveling the mechanisms underlying patients’ response to anticancer drugs and identification of their genetic profile would enable the development of new, personalized drugs to prolong patients’ overall survival, as well as quality of life. Conclusions Cancer patients’ chemotherapeutic response and outcome depends on multiple redundant and diverse biological processes and molecular mechanisms that affect the sensitivity of cancer cells to chemotherapy drugs. Multiple molecular determinants of intrinsic and acquired resistance, including genetic/epigenetic factors, as well as membrane transporter proteins that act at the genomic or cellular level respectively, have been identified. The key genes/gene products found in this review study to be involved in chemoresistance were used to construct an interaction network (Fig. 1). These molecules are, in most cases, highly interconnected and some of them (TP53, TP73, VEGFA, HIF1A, ABCB1, ABCG2 and TOP1) act as ‘hubs’. This leads to the suggestion that these genes/proteins may play a central role in drug sensitivity/ resistance by interacting with each other, either functionally or physically. Novel targeted therapies for cancer must be developed that would be directed toward cellular drug resistance, and specifically to the ‘hub’ genes. The goal of these therapies must be to achieve maximum chemotherapeutic effect by eliminating cancer cells, with reduced normal tissue toxicity.

20	2018	Revisiting the role of ABC transporters in multidrug- resistant cancer	Abstract Most patients who die of cancer have disseminated disease that has become resistant to multiple therapeutic modalities. Ample evidence suggests that the expression of ATP- binding cassette (ABC) transporters, especially the multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1, also known as P- glycoprotein or P- gp), which is encoded by ABC subfamily B member 1 (ABCB1), can confer resistance to cytotoxic and targeted chemotherapy. However, the development of MDR1 as a therapeutic target has been unsuccessful. At the time of its discovery , appropriate tools for the characterization and clinical development of MDR1 as a therapeutic target were lacking. Thirty years after the initial cloning and characterization of MDR1 and the implication of two additional ABC transporters, the multidrug resistanceassociated protein 1 (MRP1; encoded by ABCC1)), and ABCG2, in multidrug resistance, interest in investigating these transporters as therapeutic targets has waned. However, with the emergence of new data and advanced techniques, we propose to re- evaluate whether these transporters play a clinical role in multidrug resistance. With this Opinion article, we present recent evidence indicating that it is time to revisit the investigation into the role of ABC transporters in efficient drug delivery in various cancer types and at the blood–brain barrier. anticancer drugs and biological therapies and to catalogue and study hundreds of potential mechanisms of resistance to these treatment modalities1, most patients with metastatic cancer will die from multidrugresistant disease. Development of multidrug resistance — the acquisition of resistance to multiple, structurally unrelated compounds — is a frequent problem in the treatment of cancer and should be distinguished from resistance to anticancer drugs with precise targets and immune therapies that are not examples of multidrug resistance. There are several extensive reviews detailing the history and development of this field2–5. Acquired multidrug resistance has been intensively studied, and the basic science is well established. Over 50 years ago, a HeLa subline was described that exhibited actinomycin D resistance following selection in 0.1 μg ml−1 of the drug6. When Chinese hamster lung and fibroblast cells were grown is multidrug resistance protein 1, MDR1. The murine homologue was found to confer resistance to doxorubicin, colchicine and vincristine when transfected into drug- sensitive LR23 hamster cells13. These seminal findings launched the study of ABC transporters, with a family of 48 human membrane transporters identified and shown to be involved in diverse physiological processes14. The second member of the ABC transporter family that was identified, multidrug resistance- associated protein 1 (MRP1), encoded by ABCC1, was first reported in 1992 (ref.15). It was found in cell line models to mediate resistance to doxorubicin, etoposide and vincristine among others16, but evidence of ubiquitous expression and lack of convincing evidence that it plays a role in clinical drug resistance has meant it is unlikely to be a suitable target for anticancer therapy. The third member of the ABC transporter family that was identified, ABCG2 (also known as breast cancer resistance protein, BCRP), encoded by ABCG2, was reported by three different groups within the span of a few months17–19. These findings increased interest in the study of ABC transporters but added complexity to the definition of multidrug resistance. Although the substrates and key roles for most of these transporters have been identified, the extent to which these transporters play a role in clinical multidrug resistance has not been clarified yet. Despite the clinical failure of MDR1 inhibitors, recent evidence suggests that expression of ABC transporters plays a role in clinical multidrug resistance in some settings. In the following sections, we argue that a contemporary understanding and reanalysis of target biology and the identification and development of efficient biomarkers using advanced technologies could identify settings in which transporters involved in multidrug resistance could be considered important therapeutic targets. Structure and function The 48 human ABC transporter genes are classified into seven subfamilies (termed ABC subfamily A through ABC subfamily G)20,21. Structurally, ABC transporters are typified by a characteristic four- domain in actinomycin D to select for resistance, the selected cells were resistant not only to actinomycin D but also to vinblastine, vincristine and daunomycin7. Another study showed that the agent daunomycin was actively transported out of multidrugresistant mouse Ehrlich ascites cells, suggesting the existence of a promiscuous membrane transporter that confers multidrug resistance8. This transporter was later identified in multidrug- resistant Chinese hamster ovary cells and called ‘P- glycoprotein’ because transporter expression was associated with altered drug permeability in resistant cells9. The gene encoding P- glycoprotein in Chinese hamster ovary cells was subsequently cloned10; the human homologue was reported soon after and the gene termed multidrug resistance (MDR) in the respective study11,12. The human gene is from here on referred to as ATP- binding cassette (ABC) subfamily B member 1, ABCB1, and its protein product architecture consisting of two cytoplasmic nucleotide- binding domains (NBDs) that bind and hydrolyse ATP and two transmembrane domains (TMDs) that recognize and transport substrates (Fig. 1a). Whereas the structure and function of NBDs are similar throughout families, TMDs are highly heterogeneous, allowing transporters to recognize diverse substrates and use the energy from ATP hydrolysis to translocate molecules across membranes, irrespective of the prevailing concentration gradient22. Recent work suggests that while the energy from ATP can help translocate engaged substrates, basal ATP hydrolysis drives a continuously changing conformation that may facilitate MDR1 binding and transport of a wide range of substrates23 (Fig. 1b). High- resolution structures of MRP1 (ref.24) and ABCG2 (ref.25) determined using cryo- electron microscopy have helped to clarify the drug- binding domains but have left the precise translocation mechanism unresolved. ABC transporters regulate cellular levels of hormones, lipids, ions, xenobiotics and other small molecules by transporting molecules across cell membranes and serve a range of physiological roles, including intracellular regulation of organelles such as the mitochondrion26, lysosome27, endoplasmic reticulum28 and Golgi apparatus29. Loss of function of a particular ABC transporter via germline mutation is associated with a number of heritable diseases, including cystic fibrosis (associated with mutation of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), encoded by CFTR (also known as ABCC7)), pseudoxanthoma elasticum (associated with mutation of MRP6, encoded by ABCC6), Stargardt macular degeneration (associated with mutation of ABCA4), Tangier disease (associated with mutation of ABCA1), sitosterolaemia (associated with mutation of ABCG5 or ABCG8) and harlequin ichthyosis (associated with mutation of ABCA12)30. The research and management of these disorders present considerable biological and clinical challenges, as the development of small molecules or gene therapy is required that enables normalization of mutant transporters via strategies such as ribosomal readthrough, stabilization of messenger mRNA31, correction of folding defects32, correction of trafficking defects33,34, allosteric activation35, modulation of protein–protein interactions36, control of post- translational regulation37, regulation of protein degradation pathways37,38 or induction of compensatory mechanisms39. Prospects are improved somewhat given that restoration of activity to as little as 5% of that of wild- type basal activity can be sufficient to partially ameliorate disorder phenotypes40,41. It should be noted that among the 48 ABC transporters, some have very narrow substrate specificity, whereas others have a broad substrate specificity. It is the transporters with broad substrate specificity that have the potential to transport a range of anticanc transporters in tumour cells may determine the ability to confer drug resistance42. It has been difficult to determine which transporters deserve the most scrutiny to define their role in multidrug resistance, as the use of cell lines with high ABC transporter expression levels in some cases led to an overestimation of their role in cancer. The reader is referred to several reviews compiling substrate lists of a range of transporters43–45. One detailed compilation notes that 19 of the 48 ABC transporters have been shown to efflux anticancer agents in some context43. We focus on the subset of ABC transporters that were first reported as multidrug efflux pumps (MDR1, MRP1 and ABCG2), what we have learned about their basic science, how clinical application has faltered and what might constitute a path forward, focusing on the most recent work in this field. MDR1, MRP1 and ABCG2 have excretory and/or protective physiological capacities by transporting substrates across biological membranes. At the blood–brain barrier (BBB), the blood– testis barrier and the blood–placental barrier, expression of ABC transporters in the capillary endothelial cells serves to prevent entry of exogenous molecules46,47. A consequence of these protective roles is that these transporters can affect pharmacokinetic parameters of drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity48. Inhibition of ABC transporters often leads to toxicities or pharmacokinetic changes owing to drug–drug interactions48, and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) offers guidance on how investigational drugs should be characterized with regard to their ability to interact with ABC transporters49. The multidrug resistance hypothesis Nearly 40 years of findings from cell culture and animal models indicate that the efflux activity of ABC transporters mediates multidrug resistance. The potential importance of ABC transporters in multidrug resistance is illustrated by the numerous anticancer agents that have been identified as substrates, including anthracyclines, taxanes, vinca alkaloids, camptothecins, epipodophyllotoxins and tyrosine kinase inhibitors1,50. Although there is considerable overlap among the substrate profiles of the various ABC transporters, there are some differences. MRP1 has been shown to transport various neutral and anionic hydrophobic compounds and products of phase II drug metabolism, including many glutathione and glucuronide conjugates51. ABCG2 transports the anticancer drugs methotrexate, mitoxantrone, topotecan, irinotecan and flavopiridol52. In addition to efforts to define ABC transporter structure and function, efforts have been made to define the clinical roles of ABC transporters in multidrug resistance, primarily for MDR1, the first transporter to be discovered. These studies generally used RNA- based or immunohistochemical methods of detection and examined association with outcomes53. Numerous studies reported the presence of MDR1 mRNA and protein in clinical samples — in leukaemias and in kidney, colon, breast and lung cancers — and, typically, MDR1 expression portendeds a poor response to chemotherapy53–55. These results led to the development of clinical trials to test the multidrug resistance hypothesis that inhibitors of MDR1 could improve response to chemotherapy and outcome via increased drug accumulation mediated by inhibition of drug transport56,57. Targeting MDR1 After the discovery of MDR1, a number of first- generation inhibitors, including verapamil, quinidine, amiodarone and cyclosporine A, were identified and added to chemotherapy regimens in clinical trials56. However, these agents were not very potent or were toxic in their own right, and their ability to inhibit MDR1 was not verified in patients5. The second- generation agents valspodar and dexverapamil were more potent MDR1 inhibitors56. Surrogate assays were used to confirm that serum concentrations of inhibitors such as valspodar were adequate to inhibit rhodamine 123 transport in MDR1-positive circulating CD56+ cells after inhibitor administration58,59. However, at that point in time, neither the expression nor the function of MDR1 in tumours had been verified, nor whether the inhibitors actually blocked drug efflux in tumour cells. Additionally, pharmacokinetic interactions with the inhibitors, such as the inhibition of cytochrome P450 by valspodar, required chemotherapy dose reductions, leading to potential underdosing of patients60. A third generation of inhibitors, including dofequidar, zosuquidar, tariquidar, elacridar and biricodar, were developed specifically as MDR1 inhibitors. These were more potent and displayed fewer pharmacokinetic interactions than inhibitors of previous generations but caused some toxicity in combination with chemotherapy, potentially owing to inhibition of MDR1 expressed in normal tissue57. Importantly, some showed cross reactivity with MRP1 and/or ABCG2 (refs61–64). Elacridar and tariquidar were found to inhibit both MDR1 and ABCG2 (refs61,64) while cyclosporine A and biricodar were found to inhibit MDR1, MRP1 and ABCG2 (refs62,63). Interestingly, the combination of cyclosporine A with chemotherapy led to increased response in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) in one study65; however, these results could not be duplicated in studies with other inhibitors66. Unfortunately, despite a few early successes, the majority of clinical trials with MDR1 inhibitors, even third- generation inhibitors, did not confirm clinical benefit57. The lack of success of these inhibitors in clinical trials resulted in a nearly complete shutdown of study in the field after these trials were completed, and the clinical validation and development of specific inhibitors for other ABC transporters potentially involved in multidrug resistance was not pursued. Further clinical trials using MDR1 inhibitors were vehemently discouraged67. However, some experimental work on mechanistic and functional aspects of ABC transporters continued, including efforts to define substrates and inhibitors of ABC transporters, the role of ABC transporters in the BBB and the role of ABC transporters in pharmacology. As noted above, the FDA now offers guidance on measuring the interaction of novel therapies with ABC transporters during clinical development49 because ABC transporters can be critical determinants of drug pharmacokinetics, including oral availability, drug–drug interactions and drug toxicity. Of note, recent reports reduced drug accumulation in clinical drug resistance. However, gene expression, gene mutation and single- nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) studies have provided new evidence supporting the potential benefit of a re- examination of ABC transporters in clinical drug resistance. Additionally, the use of genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) has provided new impetus for examining the role of ABC transporters in acquired resistance to certain drugs, such as doxorubicin, topotecan and some poly(ADP- ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. Imaging studies and mouse models examining the role of ABC transporters in the gastrointestinal tract and at the BBB have consistently demonstrated that the activities of MDR1 and ABCG2 are significant impediments to anticancer agent oral absorption and brain exposure78. A summary of the new evidence supporting the role of ABC transporters in drug resistance is given in the next section. ABC transporters in resistance MDR1 overexpression is associated with resistance in some tumour subsets. Many of the early clinical trials to test the MDR1 hypothesis were designed for patients with AML56. Although largely unsuccessful, we now recognize their design was optimistic and success unlikely given that the focus was only on MDR1, and patients were not selected based on MDR1 expression or potential MDR1 involvement in the patient’s resistance to therapy55. For example, gene expression profiling in 170 AML samples showed that only 13% of the samples were refractory and positive for ABCB1 or ABCG2 expression79. Whole- genome sequencing of 92 patients with high- grade serous ovarian carcinoma with primary and matched resistant disease showed that amplification of cyclin E1 (CCNE1) and reversion of BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 mutations were potential mechanisms of resistance. Interestingly, the authors also found recurrent promoter fusions associated with overexpression of ABCB1 (ref.80). These promoter fusions, occurring in about 8% of patients with resistant disease, lead to ABCB1 overexpression. The underlying gene rearrangements place a more active promoter at the 5′ end of the ABCB1 transcript81,82 (Fig. 2). These gene rearrangements are monoallelic, with the remaining alleles being transcribed normally81,82. This mechanism has first been reported in cell culture models and in clinical samples from patients with refractory acute lymphoblastic leukaemia81,82. Of note, paclitaxel and docetaxel, the main therapies used in ovarian cancer, which were administered to patients in this study before recurrence, are substrates of MDR1 (ref.80). In our view, these observations suggest that the ABCB1 gene rearrangements were selected for in the drug- resistant phenotype; however, the low occurrence rate of these gene rearrangements argues that they might occur only in a particular molecular background. As previously reported using a TaqMan low- density array, only a small percentage of ovarian cancers show high Expression of multiple ABC transporters. It is now clear that multiple ABC transporters may be expressed in a single tumour type. A study that examined expression of all 48 human ABC transporters in 281 AML samples found in a multivariate analysis that expression of ABCB1, ABCG1 and ABCG2 was linked to overall survival, and the overall survival decreased with increasing number of transporter genes co- expressed84. Similar results were observed in childhood AML, where ABCA3, ABCB1, ABCC3 and ABCG2 mRNA expression levels were measured by real- time PCR, and the increasing number of co- expressed ABC transporters correlated with shorter relapse- free survival85. Finally, in a set of 11 paired samples taken from patients with AML at diagnosis and relapse, a twofold overexpression of at least one ABC transporter capable of transporting anthracyclines or vinca alkaloids was found in ten of the paired samples86. Although the links between ABC transporter coexpression and clinical outcome are correlative and have not been shown to be causal, together these results suggest that inhibition of multiple transporters might be required to achieve clinical benefit. This may be especially true for primitive leukaemic CD34+CD38- cells, the putative stem cell population. This cell population has been shown to express high levels of ABCG2 as well as potentially MDR1 and MRP1 in some patient samples87. Expression of ABCG2 and MDR1 in this cell population has been found to correlate with response to chemotherapy both clinically and when measured ex vivo in leukaemic blast samples88. It remains to be determined whether all or a subset of these ABC transporters may be involved in the efflux of anticancer drugs in the clinical setting. Support for the idea that the expression of multiple ABC transporters correlates with a resistance phenotype has also been found in solid tumours. A study of all ABC transporters in pancreatic cancer found significant upregulation of ABCB4, ABCB11, ABCC1, ABCC3, ABCC5, ABCC10 and ABCG2 at the mRNA level in macrodissected tumours relative to normal tissue, although the study did not attempt to correlate transporter expression with chemotherapy response89. However, the fact that tumour samples were not microdissected may be a confounding factor. ABCB1 mRNA, which is physiologically expressed at high levels in cells of the pancreatic duct and acinar cells90, was not upregulated in tumour tissue compared with normal tissue. Upregulation of ABC transporter expression beyond the high levels found in normal tissue may not be necessary to confer drug resistance, as in hepatocellular carcinoma, where expression levels of multiple ABC transporters have been reported to be similar to the already high levels of expression in normal liver cells91,92. With the advent of genomic analysis, we have an unbiased approach to measuring ABC transporter mRNA expression. It is now possible to measure expression of all transporters simultaneously rather than focusing on certain transporters that we hypothesize might be involved in resistance. Analysis of RNA sequencing (RNA- seq) data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database found that expression of both ABCB1 and ABCG2 in a variety of tumour types ranges over 1,000-fold (Fig. 3), a far greater range of expression than was reported in studies using older technologies. Although a frequent criticism of early MDR1 studies was that in vitro levels of ABCB1 are much higher than those found in patient tumours93, this broad range suggests very high levels in some tumours. However, it has been reported that in the case of some tumours, such as breast cancer, ABCB1 expression is found primarily in tumour- associated macrophages and not in the tumour samples themselves94, and high stromal expression of ABC transporters could skew expression values in RNA- seq data from tumour samples. Discordance between RNA and immunohistochemical data is thought to be responsible for this problem in some cases95, but doubts in regards to antibody specificity have also been expressed96. Despite this caveat, it is interesting that tumour types most refractory to chemotherapy are among those with the highest levels of ABCB1 or ABCG2 expression. Tumour tissues from hepatocellular carcinomas and kidney cancers show the highest levels of expression of both ABCB1 and ABCG2 compared with other cancer types (Fig. 3). While RTK inhibitors are approved for the treatment of both of these types of cancer97, these cancer types show frequent resistance to the mainstay chemotherapeutics such as vincristine and doxorubicin, which are MDR1 substrates53. Of note, the ability to detect RNA transcript levels more accurately via newer technologies does not really overcome the deficiencies in our understanding of the role of ABC transporters in multidrug resistance. These deficiencies include the lack of a direct demonstration of how ABC transporter activity affects drug accumulation in cancer cells and the clinical significance of that activity. The studies outlined above indicate that only a fraction of cancers express ABC transporters at levels that could potentially be linked to drug resistance. MDR1 is expressed in only 13% of AML, 8% of ovarian cancers and 30% of ALK- positive non- small-cell lung carcinoma samples, suggesting that MDR1 should have been targeted as cancer mutations are today, where patients are carefully screened and selected for expression of the target in tumour cells. In addition, expression of more than one ABC transporter is common. Clinical studies of MDR1 inhibitors in the past did not routinely include molecular characterization of tumour tissues56 and thus were likely confounded by the inclusion of patients who had low tumour levels of MDR1, and in whom MDR1 inhibition would have had no predicted clinical benefit. Single- nucleotide polymorphism studies to determine the role of ABC transporters. One way to determine whether MDR1 plays a role in anticancer drug resistance is to evaluate the impact of polymorphic variants on chemotherapy response or cancer outcome. Polymorphic variants of ABC transporter genes that impair substrate efflux could be associated with a higher cancer incidence owing to decreased xenobiotic efflux and impaired normal tissue protection because of decreased ABC transporter efficacy, but they could also be associated with a better outcome once a cancer is diagnosed because of reduced chemotherapy drug efflux. However, multiple variables confound such associations: not all cancers are linked to xenobiotic exposure; not all cancer chemotherapeutics are substrates for ABC transporters; current methods provide incomplete information on the transport activity of polymorphic variants of ABC transporters; and clinical outcome may be impacted by coexisting polymorphic variants in multiple ABC transporter genes. As a result of this complexity, the literature on clinical outcomes associated with polymorphic variants of ABCB1 is contradictory98–101. The largest and most reliable SNP association study to date was based on RNAseq data derived from the TCGA database, examining RNA sequence and expression data from 4,616 ovarian cancer patients who had received any form of adjuvant chemotherapy102. In particular, the correlation of three common coding SNPs tagging either C1236T (rs1128503), G2677T/A (rs2032582) or C3435T (rs1045642) of ABCB1 in patients with prior chemotherapy was determined102, and only a marginal association of C1236T with improved overall survival was found. The study also reported that ABCB1 mRNA overexpression in 143 serous ovarian tumours was associated with a worse prognosis in suboptimally debulked patients102. Transporter expression in mouse models of acquired resistance. Expression of ABC transporters emerged as the principal mechanism of resistance in an elegant series of studies involving a GEMM of hereditary breast cancer that arises in the mammary epithelium of mice deficient for Brca1 and Trp53 (ref.103). Treatment of animals from this model with the maximum tolerable dose of docetaxel or doxorubicin, both MDR1 substrates, led to an initial differential response in mice, but, eventually, all tumours became resistant to treatment. Gene expression analysis was subsequently performed on 13 doxorubicin- resistant tumours, and upregulation of mRNA expression levels of Abcb1a and/or Abcb1b (the murine orthologues of ABCB1) were found in 11 of the 13 tumour samples compared with the matched, sensitive tumours103. These doxorubicin- resistant tumours were also resistant to docetaxel. In a subsequent study, transport of 99mTc- MIBI, a contrast agent used in cardiac imaging that is a substrate of MDR1 (ref.104), was also demonstrated in mice harbouring the doxorubicin- resistant tumours generated from the mice described above103 that overexpressed Abcb1a and Abcb1b but not in control tumours105. Similar results were obtained when the mice deficient in Brca1 and Trp53 were treated with the PARP inhibitor olaparib: all tumours responded initially to a 28-consecutiveday treatment, but, eventually, all tumours acquired resistance. When compared with their olaparib- responsive counterparts, recurring tumours overexpressed Abcb1a and/or Abcb1b106. The addition of tariquidar to olaparib treatment resensitized tumours expressing Abcb1a and/or Abcb1b to olaparib, indicating a role of MDR1 in olaparib resistance in these tumours, whereas the addition of tariquidar alone had no effect on growth106. In doxorubicin- resistant tumours arising in this model, moderate increases in MDR1 expression — as little as twofold compared with treatment- naive tumours — was found in 11 of 13 tumours compared with untreated tumours. In some of these resistant tumours, resistance to doxorubicin could be overcome by the addition of tariquidar to doxorubicin treatment, whereas tariquidar itself had no effect107. In a separate study using the same mouse model, when tumour- bearing mice were treated with the topoisomerase I inhibitor topotecan, heterogeneous responses were observed, but, eventually, all tumours developed resistance to topotecan108. Of the 20 topotecan- resistant tumours that were examined, 9 expressed at least twofold higher levels of Abcg2 compared with matched untreated control tumours. When Abcg2-null alleles were introduced into the mice deficient in Brca1 and Trp53, the resulting tumours were transplanted into syngeneic wild- type animals, which were subsequently treated with topotecan. Mice bearing tumours deficient in Brca1, Trp53 and Abcg2 had an increased overall survival compared with mice bearing tumours deficient in Brca1 and Trp53 and expressing Abcg2, suggesting that Abcg2 contributed to topotecan resistance in this model103. Of note, expression of Abcc1 and Abcc4, which have also been implicated in topotecan resistance, were not found to be increased in resistant tumours compared with matched untreated control tumours108. In order to test the efficacy of the ABCG2 inhibitor Ko143 on topotecanresistant Brca1 and Trp53-deficient tumours that overexpressed Abcg2, tumours were transplanted into Abcg2-deficient mice so as to overcome the effects of Abcg2 on topotecan clearance109. Compared with tumours treated with topotecan alone, the addition of Ko143 was not able to completely overcome tumour resistance to topotecan, as overall survival only moderately increased from 52 to 71.5 days. This could be due to the short plasma half- life of Ko143. To further explore the role of Abcg2 in drug resistance, the efficacy of EZN-2208 (a pegylated form of SN-38) was compared with irinotecan. The active metabolite of EZN-2208, SN-38, is an ABCG2 substrate108. Pegylation of SN-38 allows for sustained release of SN-38 and may overcome ABCG2-mediated resistance108. Overall survival of mice treated with EZN-2208 was doubled compared with mice treated with irinotecan alone108, suggesting that thwarting the activity of ABCG2 increases sensitivity to substrate drugs. Similar observations have been reported in other GEMMs. In a mouse model of mammary tumours deficient in Brca2 and Trp53, Abcb1a and/or Abcb1b expression was higher in three of four chemo- naive tumours with a sarcomatoid phenotype, referred to as carcinosarcoma, compared with the carcinomas that predominantly arise from this model; all carcinosarcomas expressed higher levels of Abcg2 compared with the carcinomas110. Additionally, when four treatment- naive carcinosarcomas were treated with the maximum tolerated dose of topotecan, docetaxel, doxorubicin or olaparib, none of the tumours responded110. When mice bearing the carcinosarcoma with the highest level of Abcb1a and Abcb1b were treated with olaparib, docetaxel or doxorubicin in the presence of tariquidar, significantly higher growth delay was observed compared with mice treated with chemotherapy or tariquidar alone110. After genetically sequencing a panel of ten carcinomas and four carcinosarcomas derived from this same model, unsupervised clustering was performed using an epithelial- to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) genetic signature110. Interestingly, the carcinosarcomas, which express higher levels of Abcb1a, Abcb1b and Abcg2, were found to have higher expression of mesenchymal genes and lower expression of epithelial genes110. An examination of ABCB1 expression in human triple- negative breast cancer samples mined from a previous study111 demonstrated that tumours with an EMT phenotype (low expression of the EMT marker claudin) had high basal levels of ABCB1 expression compared with basal- like tumours112. Despite these elegant studies in mice that ABC transporter expression in the gastrointestinal tract is known to affect the oral bioavailability of some chemotherapy drugs that are ABC transporter substrates. This has been shown for taxanes and topotecan, which are not given orally owing to interactions with MDR1 and ABCG2, respectively. The dual MDR1 and ABCG2 inhibitor elacridar has been combined in exploratory trials with oral taxol115 or topotecan116 to increase oral bioavailability in patients; however, the clinical efficacy of these combinations has not been reported. The expression of ABC transporters in the gastrointestinal tract might have the potential to cause drug resistance. For example, when Caco-2 intestinal cells were chronically exposed to imatinib, MDR1 and ABCG2 expression was induced117. If this were to occur in the gastrointestinal tract, it would limit oral availability of imatinib, resulting in lower serum concentrations and resistance to the drug, although this has yet to be demonstrated in vivo or in the clinic. ABC transporters at the blood–brain barrier limit drug uptake. One of the stunning discoveries made during the evolution of this field was the critical importance of MDR1 at the BBB, which was first shown in mouse models in which deletion of Abcb1a and Abcb1b resulted in central nervous system (CNS) toxicity from ivermectin, an antiparasitic commonly used on animals118. After the discovery of ABCG2, mice lacking Abcb1a, Abcb1b and Abcg2 were generated78. A systematic series of investigations demonstrated the often overlapping and synergistic role of these two transporters in restricting the entrance of anticancer therapeutics to the brain in	Robert W.

21	2015	Structure and mechanism of ABC transporters	Abstract All living organisms depend on primary and secondary membrane transport for the supply of external nutrients and removal or sequestration of unwanted (toxic) compounds. Due to the chemical diversity of cellular molecules, it comes as no surprise that a significant part of the proteome is dedicated to the active transport of cargo across the plasma membrane or the membranes of subcellular organelles. Transport against a chemical gradient can be driven by, for example, the free energy change associated with ATP hydrolysis (primary transport), or facilitated by the potential energy of the chemical gradient of another molecule (secondary transport). Primary transporters include the rotary motor ATPases (F-, A-, and V-ATPases), P-type ATPases and a large family of integral membrane proteins referred to as “ABC” (ATP-binding cassette) transporters. ABC transporters are widespread in all forms of life and are characterized by two nucleotide-binding domains (NBD) and two transmembrane domains (TMDs). ATP hydrolysis on the NBD drives conformational changes in the TMD, resulting in alternating access from inside and outside of the cell for unidirectional transport across the lipid bilayer. Common to all ABC transporters is a signature sequence or motif, LSGGQ, that is involved in nucleotide binding. Both importing and exporting ABC transporters are found in bacteria, whereas the majority of eukaryotic family members function in the direction of export. Recent progress with the X-ray crystal structure determination of a variety of bacterial and eukaryotic ABC transporters has helped to advance our understanding of the ATP hydrolysis-driven transport mechanism but has also illustrated the large structural and functional diversity within the family. Introduction The transport of organic and inorganic molecules across cellular membranes is vital to all forms of life, as it allows cells to maintain an off equilibrium condition. In Escherichia coli, for example, ~10% of the entire genome is dedicated to membrane-bound and soluble proteins involved in transport processes [1]. On the timescale relevant for cellular metabolism, the lipid bilayer represents a formidable barrier for most charged and polar molecules while allowing for the passage of hydrophobic organic compounds by passive diffusion [2]. Transport against a chemical gradient (e.g. import of nutrients) requires a source of free energy, either provided by the potential energy of an existing chemical gradient or a coupled enzymatic reaction. Transporters that are driven by the chemical gradient of a “helper” molecule are referred to as secondary transporters, while transporters that generate the driving force by an enzymatic reaction with a “high energy” molecule (mostly ATP) are called primary transporters (see the Transporter Classification Database [www.tcdb.org] for details) [3]. Transporters that use ATP hydrolysis to pump molecules across the membrane are referred to as transport ATPases, a large superfamily that includes the rotarymotor F-, A-, and V-ATPases, the P-type ATPases and the ABC transporters [4]. While transport substrates of the rotary motor and P-type ATPases are, with few exceptions, limited to protons or metal ions, ABC transporters cover a wide spectrum of substrates, from small inorganic and organic molecules, such as amino acids, sugars, nucleosides, vitamins and metal clusters to larger organic compounds, including peptides, lipid molecules, oligonucleotides and polysaccharides. Over the past decade, several moderateto- high resolution crystal structures have been solved for that all contained an essential cytoplasmic factor with ATP hydrolysis activity (reviewed in [5]). As more amino acid sequence information became available, it was recognized that the primary structure of the ATP-binding domains of these transporters was highly conserved, including the presence of a phosphate-binding loop (P-loop or Walker A motif) and a short consensus sequence “LSGGQ”. The family of transporters was subsequently termed ABC transporters in recognition of the “cassette-like” nature of the ATP-binding subunit [6]. Around the same time, biochemical studies on the mammalian multi-drug resistance (MDR) export pump P-glycoprotein revealed the presence of the very same motifs in its ATP-binding domain, demonstrating that the family of ABC transporters was represented not only in bacteria but also higher eukaryotes, including mammals. From the current sequence information of microbial genomes, ABC transporters represent the largest protein family identified to date, highlighted by the fact that between 1 and 3% of bacterial and archaeal genomes encode for subunits of ABC transporters [7]. There are 48 ABC transporters in human [8,9] and many of these have been shown to be responsible for or involved in disease states, including cystic fibrosis, Tangier disease, adrenoleukodystrophy, and cancer (see below). General architecture of ABC transporters ABC transporters classified so far can be grouped into exporters and importerswith the importers further divided into two classes (I and II), depending on details of their architecture andmechanism [10-12]. The related family of energy-coupling factor (ECF) transporters [13,14] (sometimes referred to as class III ABC importers) is structurally and functionally more distinct [15,16], and this class will not be discussed here. While bacteria employ both ABC importers and exporters, eukaryotes, with very few exceptions, only have exporters. The canonical ABC transporter is organized in four functional units or domains, two NBDs (NBD1, NBD2) and two TMDs (TMD1, TMD2). In bacteria, the four domains can be a combination of individual, pairwise identical subunits, or a combination of fused NBDs and/or TMDs [12]. In eukaryotes, the majority of ABC transporters are constituted by a single polypeptide that contains all four functional units, with some members assembled from “half” transporters with either identical (homodimeric) or different (heterodimeric) halves. Besides the four main domains, bacterial importers require an accessory subunit that is responsible for capturing transport substrate (solute) and delivering it to the binding site in the TMDs. In Gramnegative bacteria, the accessory subunits are 30-50 kDa soluble proteins that are found in the periplasm, while in Gram-positive microorganisms, the accessory subunits are lipoproteins anchored to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. Figure 1 gives an overview of some of the prominent ABC transporter family members for which high-resolution structural information is available. Structure and properties of the NBDs Thanks to its high level of similarity and the presence of several conserved motifs, the NBD or ATP-binding cassette is the hallmark of the ABC transporter family. Sequence identity for the NBDs within and between bacterial and eukaryotic exporters is high, with values between 30 and 50%, pointing to a similar threedimensional fold and a conserved mechanism of energy coupling. The conserved nature of the tertiary structure can be seen in X-ray crystal structures of isolated NBDs and NBDs that are part of intact transporters. Early structures of isolated NBDs, for example, the histidine permease [17], Rad50 [18] (a DNA repair protein), the archaeal ABC transporter MJ0796 [19], and the maltose transporter [20], revealed the presence of a RecA-like domain with a Rossman fold and Walker A motif typical for NBDs, as well as an a-helical domain that contains the signature sequence LSGGQthat is characteristic for the NBDs of ABC transporters. These crystal structures of isolated NBDs bound to ATP showed the two NBDs engaged in a symmetric dimer with the two ATPmolecules sandwiched in the dimer interface (except for the histidine permease NBDs, which crystallized as a non-physiological dimer [17]). In this so-called “sandwich dimer”, ATP is bound to NBD1 coordinated by P-loop residues from NBD1 and from residues of the signature sequence of NBD2 and vice versa for the second ATP (see Figure 1D). The ATP-bound sandwich dimer, together with the observation that nucleotide-free NBDs often crystallized as monomers or non-physiological dimers [21], suggested early on that the nucleotide-dependent dimerization of the NBDs is part of the “power stroke” driving conformational changes in the TMDs [20]. Properties of the TMDs Depending on the transporter class, each TMD has 6 to 10 transmembrane a-helices (with most exporters having 6) significant sequence conservation but share a similar topology within a transporter class. The lack of primary structure conservation in the TMDs is likely due to the diverse nature of the transport substrates. Sequence conservation can be high between TMD1 and TMD2 in eukaryotic single-polypeptide transporters (e.g. ~30% in P-glycoprotein), suggesting that the two TMDs in these transporters are a result of gene duplication originating from homodimeric ancestors. For both importers and exporters, transport substrate has to interact at one point or another with residues of the transmembrane a-helices that line the transmembrane pore. For bacterial type I importers (e.g. the maltose importer from E. coli), specific residues in the TMD that are involved in substrate binding have been identified from crystallographic studies and mutagenesis experiments [22,23]. For the E. coli vitamin B12 importer (BtuCDF, a type II importer), the translocation path does not seem to provide a specific substrate binding site but there is a hydrophobic cavity mid-membrane that can be blocked from both sides of the bilayer [24]. The situation is again different in the multidrug transporter P-glycoprotein, where several overlapping drug-binding sites have been identified [25]. The drug-binding pocket of P-glycoprotein has therefore been described as having “polyspecificity” towards its transport substrates [26-28]. Mechanism of ABC transporters With few exceptions, ABC transporters have to pump transport substrates against a chemical gradient, a process that requires ATP hydrolysis as a driving force. Under physiological conditions, ABC transporters operate in a single direction (either import or export), although the drug efflux pump LmrA has been shown to be reversible under certain conditions [29], which means that the membrane domain must operate one or more “turnstilelike” gates that are tightly coupled to the catalytic cycle on the NBDs. To satisfy this condition, the transmembrane domain alternates between outward- and inward-facing conformations, reminiscent of the mechanism originally proposed by Jardetzky for the P-type ATPases [30]. The mechanism is also employed by the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) of secondary transporters, in which case the driving force is provided by the potential energy of the chemical gradient of a “secondary” transport substrate, for example, protons or sodium ions [31]. In the case of ABC transporters, conformational switching of the membrane domain for providing alternating access is driven by the binding of transport substrate and MgATP, followed by ATP hydrolysis and product release. Based on structural and biochemical data, several models of ABC transporter mechanisms have been proposed, most notably the “alternating site” [32], “switch” [33], and “constant contact” [34,35]models.While all thesemodels share elementary steps, such as ATP-dependent NBD dimerization and the switching of the TMD between outward- and inward-facing conformations, the models diverge with respect to some of the details of the mechanism. However, it should be pointed out that there is little evidence to suggest that all ABC transporters function by the very same mechanism. Among the structurally and mechanistically best-characterized importers are the E. coli maltose [22,23] (a type I) and vitamin B12 [24,36,37] (a type II) uptake systems. For the exporters, a large amount of biochemical and structural data are available for the multidrug resistance pumps from Staphylococcus aureus (Sav1866) [38] and higher eukaryotes (P-glycoprotein, ABCB1) [27,39-41],multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP1, ABCC1) [42], the bacterial lipid flippase MsbA [43], and the transporter involved in antigen processing (TAP) [44]. The catalytic cycle The basic catalytic cycle of ABC transporters starting from the “apo” or ground state consists of a series of steps. These include the binding of substrate-binding proteins (for importers) or the direct binding of a substrate (for exporters) to the TMDs, binding of two MgATP molecules to the NBDs, dimerization of the NBDs, switching of the TMDs between the in- and outward or out- and inward-facing conformations (depending on transporter type), ATP hydrolysis, phosphate, ADP and transport substrate release concomitant with NBD dissociation to reset the transporter to the ground state for the next cycle. The details and order of these steps depend, to some extent, on the transporter type, as illustrated in Figure 2A for exporters, Figure 2B for type I importers, and Figure 2C for type II importers. However, while there is general agreement that all or some of the above steps must happen at some point during the cycle, there is much less understanding as to the exact order of these steps and which step of the ATP hydrolysis reaction on the NBDs provides the “power stroke” that resets the TMDs to the ground state. According to the switch model [33], which was inspired by biochemical studies and early crystal structures that showed (on the one hand start of a new cycle. However, there is experimental evidence that the NBDs operate in an alternating fashion [32], an observation that is difficult to reconcile with the simple switch model. Alternating ATP hydrolysis as well as occlusion of non-hydrolyzable ATPgS at one catalytic site [34,35] and drug-stimulated ATPase activity of P-glycoprotein, in which NBDs were covalently linked via disulfide bond [45], are all consistent with the constant-contact model in which NBDs remain associated during steady-state turnover to allow for sequential ATP hydrolysis. A “reciprocating twin-channel” model of transport that incorporates the constant-contact model has recently been proposed [46]. High-resolution crystal structures of the maltose transporter in pre-hydrolysis and transition state conformations showed that ATP hydrolysis is base catalyzed by a glutamate residue at the end of the Walker B motif that, together with assistance from residues in other conserved motifs (D-, Q-, and H-loops) polarizes a water molecule for the attack on the g-phosphate [23]. Since the residues involved in ATP hydrolysis are highly conserved, it is reasonable to assume that this part of the mechanism is conserved in the ABC transporter family. Curiously, the pre-hydrolysis and transition state conformations were very similar, suggesting that it is product release (likely phosphate) rather than the ATP hydrolysis step itself that leads to the structural changes in the NBDs that are coupled to the conformational rearrangements in the TMDs. Phosphate release is also part of the power stroke that drives the rotation of the central rotor in the rotary motor F-ATPases [46]. A key structural element for coupling NBD to TMD events is the Q-loop (named so for a conserved glutamine residue) and the so-called “coupling helix” at the NBDTMD interface [36,38,48]. Crystallographic and EPR spectroscopy experiments have shown that catalysis involves a rotational movement of the RecA-like domain with respect to the NBD helical domain [49,50], and that this motion is likely transferred to the TMDs by the Q-loop and the coupling helix. ABC transporters in human disease There are 48 ABC transporters in humans that can be subdivided by phylogenetic analysis into seven distinct subfamilies A-G [8,9]. Mammalian ABC transporters are involved in the cellular export of several groups of molecules, including cholesterol and sterols, lipids, retinoic acid derivatives, bile acid, iron, nucleosides, and peptides. The essential nature of these functions is highlighted by the fact that defects in the associated transporters have been observed in a number of genetic conditions, including Tangier (ABCA1) and Stargardt (ABCA4) disease [51], immune deficiency and cancer (ABCB2/3; TAP transporter) [52], cystic fibrosis (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator [CFTR]; ABCC7) [53], and adrenoleukodystrophy (ABCD1) [5], to name only a few. Another prominent group of human ABC transporters are found in the liver, placenta and blood brain barrier where they are involved in the detoxification of hydrophobic organic molecules [54]. The group includes P-glycoprotein (ABCB1), one of the best-studied ABC transporters, the MRP (ABCC1) and ABCG2. These transporters, when found highly expressed in the plasma membrane of tumor cells, can result in the failure of chemotherapy by protecting the cancer cells from the cytotoxic drugs used to fight the disease. Much effort has been spent on identifying selective inhibitors for these MDR transporters and while many compounds have been identified that inhibit P-glycoprotein function in, for example, human cell culture, no broadly applicable inhibitor is in use as of yet, due to significant side effects of the compounds [55]. Non-canonical ABC transporters While the majority of ABC transporters characterized so far are just that, membrane transporters, there are a number of family members that have evolved to perform different functions. CFTR, for example, is a chloride channel, and gating of the channel is regulated by the nucleotide content of the NBDs [53]. CFTR also belongs to a class of ABC transporters in which one of the nucleotide-binding sites is “degenerate”, resulting in a catalytic site that is still able to bind but not hydrolyze ATP efficiently. Another atypical ABC “transporter” with one degenerate ATP-binding site is the sulfonylurea receptor (SUR; ABCC8/9) [56]. SUR forms a large tetrameric complex with an inward-rectifying potassium channel (KATP), and it has been proposed that the ABC transporter in this complex functions in regulation of the activity of the channel by sensing cellular ATP levels. Unresolved questions: the to-do list Despite the recent progress with understanding ABC transporter mechanism, many questions remain as to some of the details of the catalytic cycle, including how many ATPs are hydrolyzed per transport event and which step of the hydrolysis cycle provides the power stroke, whether ATP hydrolysis in one NBD is sufficient for transport, and whether NBDs remain associated during transport, to name only a few. However, as pointed out earlier, some of these questions may have different answers depending on the nature of the transporter. While we now have a good collection of crystal structures, additional structures of catalytic intermediates will be needed for a more complete understanding of the transport cycle, especially for the class of exporters. Of course, the high-resolution structures will have to be complemented by biochemical and biophysical studies that address the kinetics and dynamics of the transporters. From studies with the MDR pump P-glycoprotein, for example, it was shown that mutating catalytic residues or trapping ADP-vanadate in only one NBD abolished ATPase and transport activity completely, an observation that leads to the proposal of the alternating site mechanism in which the two catalytic sites hydrolyze ATP in an alternating fashion [32]. Support for such a mechanism was provided by experiments that showed that the non-hydrolyzable ATP analog ATPgS can be stably trapped in one catalytic site, leading to an “occluded” nucleotide state [34,35]. However, most of the crystal structures of ABC transporters or isolated NBDs show symmetric occupancy of the NBDs with either nucleotides alone or transition state analogs bound, and so the question of whether nucleotides are hydrolyzed simultaneously, or in a specific order, remains to be determined. One approach for obtaining real-time mechanistic information is, for example, Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) spectroscopy that allows monitoring of ligand-dependent structural changes during the active turnover of single transporter molecules [57,58]. These studies already showed that the ABC transporter P-glycoprotein is a highly dynamic molecule with rapidly fluctuating NBDs. Performing measurements with immobilized or optically trapped molecules for longer observation times, and including fluorescent transport substrate for three-color FRET experiments, will make it possible to delineate and define the individual steps of the ABC transporter catalytic cycle.

22	2011	The multidrug-resistant phenotype associated with overexpression of the new ABC half-transporter, MXR (ABCG2)	Mechanisms of drug resistance other than P-glycoprotein are of increasing interest as the list of newly identified members of the ABC transport family has grown. We sought to characterize the phenotype of the newly discovered ABC transporter encoded by the mitoxantrone resistance gene, MXR, also known as ABCP1 or BCRP. The pharmacodynamics of mitoxantrone and 12 other fluorescent drugs were evaluated by confocal microscopy in four multidrug-resistant human colon (S1) and breast (MCF-7) cancer cell lines. We utilized two sublines, MCF-7 AdVp3000 and S1-M1-80, and detected overexpression of MXR by PCR, immunoblot assay and immunohistochemistry. These MXR overexpressing sublines were compared to cell lines with P-glycoproteinand MRP-mediated resistance. High levels of crossresistance were observed for mitoxantrone, the anthracyclines, bisantrene and topotecan. Reduced levels of mitoxantrone, daunorubicin, bisantrene, topotecan, rhodamine 123 and prazosin were observed in the two sublines with high MXR expression. Neither the Pglycoprotein substrates vinblastine, paclitaxel, verapamil and calcein-AM, nor the MRP substrate calcein, were extruded from MCF-7 AdVp3000 and S1-M1-80 cells. Thus, the multidrug-resistant phenotype due to MXR expression is overlapping with, but distinct from, that due to P-glycoprotein. Further, cells that overexpress the MXR protein seem to be more resistant to mitoxantrone and topotecan than cells with P-glycoprotein-mediated multidrug resistance. Our studies suggest that the ABC half-transporter, MXR, is a potent, new mechanism for conferring multiple drug resistance. Definition of its mechanism In cancer treatment, a major problem to be overcome is the resistance of tumor cells to anticancer drugs. An intensively studied type of cellular drug resistance is the multidrug resistance phenotype, which is characterized by a reduced intracellular drug level and overexpression of individual members of the ABC (ATP binding cassette) superfamily of membrane transporters (Allikmets et al., 1996; Dean and Allikmets, 1995), including the well-characterized members Pglycoprotein (P-gp), encoded by the MDR1 gene (Gottesman and Pastan, 1993) and MRP (multidrug resistance associated protein) (Müller et al., 1994). However, several atypical multidrug-resistant tumor cell lines have been described that lack overexpression of P-gp and MRP, but nevertheless have reduced intracellular drug levels, suggesting the presence of other drug transport mechanisms (Dietel et al., 1990; Mülder et al., 1993, 1994; Scheffer et al., 1995; Chen et al., 1990; Lee et al., 1997). Several of these atypical multidrug-resistant sublines were selected in mitoxantrone, including the gastric carcinoma cells EPG85-257RN (Dietel et al., 1990; Kellner et al., 1997), the human HL-60 leukemia cell line HL-60/MX2 (Harker et al., 1989), various sublines of the human breast carcinoma cell line MCF-7 (Taylor et al., 1991; Nakagawa et al., 1992; Dexter et al., 1998), and the colon carcinoma cell lines WiDr/R (Dalton et al., 1988; Fox and Smith, 1995), and S1-M1-80 (Rabindran et al., 1995). Our laboratory recently identified a mitoxantrone resistance-associated gene, MXR (GenBank accession numbers AF093771 and AF093772), in a human colon cancer subline, S1-M1-80 (Miyake et al., 1999). This gene encodes a predicted 655-amino-acid protein with six transmembrane domains; a proposed model of MXR is shown in Fig. 1A. The highest primary structure similarity was found to the half-transporter members of the ABC superfamily, including the Drosophila white gene (O’Hare et al., 1984); a phylogenetic tree constructed with the distance matrix using the neighbor-joining method (Saitou and Nei, 1987) illustrates the close relationship to the white family of ABC halftransporters, as well as to other ABC proteins, some of which are involved in drug resistance (Fig. 1B). Localized to MATERIALS AND METHODS Tissue culture All cell lines were cultured in IMEM supplemented with glutamine (2 mM), fetal calf serum (10%), penicillin (100 i.u./ml) and streptomycin (100 mg/ml). Drug-resistant cells were maintained in the presence of the selecting drugs (Table 1). The S1-B1-20 and S1-M1- 3.2 (established by Greenberger and colleagues; Rabindran et al., 1995) lines were derived from the S1 clone of LS-180 colon carcinoma cells. S1-M1-80 cells were advanced to higher levels of resistance by exposure to increasing concentrations of mitoxantrone. The cells were continuously maintained in the selecting agent, which was 20 mM bisantrene for S1-B1-20 and 80 mM mitoxantrone for S1- M1-80. The MCF-7 resistant sublines were derived by stepwise selection from parental MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells. The MCF-7 VP-16 cells, a gift from Dr Ken Cowan, were maintained in 4 mM VP-16. The MCF-7 AdVp3000 cells were independently selected from MCF-7 parental cells and were cultured in 5.5 mM adriamycin plus 5.5 mM verapamil (Lee et al., 1997). For the transfection experiment, MCF-7 cells were transfected with full-length MXR cDNA by the calcium phosphate precipitation method, and subsequently selected in G418 (1 mg/ml)-containing medium, whereas control MCF-7 cells were transfected with the empty pcDNA3 vector before selection in G418 (Doyle et al., 1998). Cytotoxicity assay The IC50 values (the drug concentration at which 50% of colony formation was inhibited) were determined in 96-well plates using the colorimetric assay described by Skehan et al. (1990). Plating concentrations varied from 2,000 cells per well (S1) to 10,000 cells per well (MCF-7 AdVp3000), due to differences in doubling time for the different cell lines. Cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of drug for 4 days, then fixed in 10% TCA (by addition of 50 ml 50% TCA to an incubation volume of 200 ml), washed and air-dried. After staining with 0.4% (w/v) sulforhodamine B in 1% (v/v) acetic acid, and washing four times in 1% (v/v) acetic acid, bound dye was solubilized with 10 mM unbuffered Tris base (pH 10.5). The number of cells per well was determined by measuring the absorbance at 540 nm in a microplate reader (Bio-Rad model 450, Bio-Rad, CA, USA). Mitoxantrone uptake Uptake of [3H]mitoxantrone by whole cells was assayed as described by Fojo et al. (1985). The incubation medium (low glucose MEM, no bicarbonate or serum, buffered with 10 mM Hepes to pH 7.3) contained 20 nM [3H]mitoxantrone. The cells were incubated in 6- well cell culture plates for 60 minutes at 37°C, washed twice with icecold phosphate-buffered saline, and subsequently trypsinized. The cell count per well was determined in a Coulter Counter (Coulter Electronics, Hialeah, FL, USA). Accumulated [3H]mitoxantrone was determined by liquid scintillation counting (Packard 2000CA TRICARB Scintillation Analyzer, Packard, IL, USA). mRNA extraction, northern blots and PCR RNA was extracted by the RNASTAT-60TM method, according to the manufacturers’ directions (TelTest Inc., Friendswood, TX, USA). Northern blotting was performed as previously described (Miyake et al., 1999). Hybridization was performed by standard procedures. For the quantitative PCR analysis, which has been described previously by Zhan et al. (1997), the following primers were used: MDR1: 5¢- end primer: 5295¢-GCC TGG CAG CTG GAA GAC AAA TAC ACA AAA TT 560, 3¢-end primer: 8145¢-CAG ACA GCA GCT GAC AGT CCA AGA ACA GG ACT 783. MRP: 5¢-end primer: 7925¢-CGG AAA CCA TCC ACG ACC CTA ATC C 816, 3¢-end primer: 10865¢-ACC TCC TCA TTC GCA TCC ACC TTG G 1062. MRP2: 5¢-end primer: 40725¢-CTG CCT CTT CAG AAT CTT AG 4091, 3¢-end primer: 43125¢- CCC AAG TTG CAG GCT GGC C 4294. MXR: 5¢-end primer: 19795¢- TGC CCA GGA CTC AAT GCA ACA G 2000, 3¢-end primer: 25405¢- GAC TGA AGG GCT ACT AAC C 2522. The expression of MDR1, MRP, MRP2 and MXR is provided in units based on densitometric measurements of the ethidium-stained PCR gels and is normalized to the expression level in wild-type (wt) cells, which is arbitrarily set at 10 units. The MXR PCR product for MCF-7 wt was readily detectable from 61.25 ng RNA amplified 30 cycles. Immunoblot analysis of proteins Microsomal membrane fractions (50 mg of protein, without boiling) were loaded onto an 8% (w/v) SDS-polyacrylamide gel and subjected to electrophoresis (Laemmli, 1970). After electrotransfer onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) the blots were blocked with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween- 20 and 5% (w/v) non-fat dry milk. Probing was performed overnight at 4°C with the polyclonal anti-MXR antibody 87405 (dilution 1:2000), which we have raised against an 18-mer peptide of the ATPbinding region of MXR (manuscript in preparation). A secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody (Affinity Bioreagents, Golden, CO, USA) was applied for 1 hour (dilution 1:1000), followed by enhanced chemiluminescence Confocal microscopy The cells (105/ml) were grown in phenol red-free IMEM for 48 hours in 35 mm glass bottom (poly-d-lysine coated) microwells (MatTek Corporation, Ashland, MA, USA) before analysis. A Zeiss LSM 410 confocal laser scanning microscope equipped with a 150 mW Omnichrome Ar-Kr laser exciting at 488 nm (all dyes except mitoxantrone) and 568 nm (mitoxantrone) was used. In our confocal microscopy of mitoxantrone we experimented with both a 568 nm and a 647 nm excitation wavelength. We chose to use the more powerful 568 nm line, as this yielded the highest signal-to-noise ratio (data not shown). Emitted light passed through a 515-540 nm band-pass filter (all dyes except mitoxantrone and daunorubicin) or a 590 nm longpass filter (mitoxantrone, daunorubicin). Images were stored online to a Panasonic optical disk drive and analyzed off-line in Paint Shop Pro v.4.14 (Jasc Inc. Eden Prairie, MN, USA). Immunohistochemistry Formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue blocks were cut into 5 mm sections. The sections were baked at 60°C, deparaffinized in xylene and ethanol, microwaved for 5 minutes until boiling in Citra Plus (BioGenex), and then microwaved for another 15 minutes at low power. Sections were quenched in 3% H2O2, and subsequently incubated in 5% goat serum for 20 minutes. Anti-MXR polyclonal antibody (87405, dilution 1:2500) was applied to the sections, and the slides incubated for 2 hours at room temperature. A biotinylated secondary antibody was next applied and slides were incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature. Finally, the antibody binding was detected with DAB. Chemicals BODIPY-vinblastine, BODIPY-verapamil, BODIPY FL-paclitaxel, BODIPY FL C5-ceramide, BODIPY FL-Brefeldin A, BODIPYprazosin, and LysoTracker Green were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR, USA). Mitoxantrone, topotecan, VP-16 and bisantrene were provided by the NCI drug screen. [3H]mitoxantrone was purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals (St Louis, MO, USA). All other drugs were purchased from Sigma (St Louis, MO, USA). RESULTS Cross-resistance patterns Table 2 shows the cytotoxicity profiles of the seven cell lines towards a panel of chemotherapeutic drugs. All drug-selected cell lines displayed resistance to mitoxantrone, the S1-M1-80 and MCF-7 AdVp3000 cells having the highest IC50 values (approximately 200-300 mM), corresponding to 35,100- and 11,300-fold relative resistance. The mitoxantrone resistance in MCF-7 AdVp3000 cells confirmed a previous report (Lee et al., 1997), but the level of resistance was about tenfold higher in the older study. Whether this is due to differences in plating density or to changes in the composition or purity of the mitoxantrone is unknown. The MCF-7 AdVp3000 and S1-M1- 80 cells had very similar cross-resistance patterns, with high resistance towards mitoxantrone, daunorubicin, bisantrene and topotecan, while retaining sensitivity towards vinblastine and paclitaxel. Some paclitaxel and vinblastine resistance was observed with the MCF-7 AdVp3000 cell line, possibly due to overexpression of MRP2 or other drug resistance mechanisms. The P-gp overexpressing S1-B1-20 cell line showed cross resistance to all drugs tested, although its IC50 value for mitoxantrone was markedly lower (0.67 mM) than that of the corresponding S1-M1-80 line (222 mM). The MCF-7 VP-16 cell line, which overexpresses MRP, was twofold resistant to daunorubicin and slightly (1.6-fold) to vinblastine, but not to mitoxantrone, bisantrene, paclitaxel or topotecan. These data underline the parallel cross-resistance profiles of the S1-M1- 80 and MCF-7 AdVp3000 sublines, and the overlap with the profile of P-gp mediated drug resistance. Expression assayed by quantitative PCR The expression levels of MDR1, MRP, MRP2 and the mitoxantrone resistance gene, MXR, were assayed by quantitative PCR. As Table 3 shows, only the atypical cell lines, S1-M1-80 and MCF-7 AdVp3000, showed high expression of MXR, which is consistent with this protein being identified as the putative drug transporter in these cells. The absolute level of expression of MXR appears to be higher in the AdVp3000 cells (2361 units versus 1703) than in S1-M1- 80 cells, a finding that is confirmed in the immunoblot results shown below. A tenfold increase in MRP2 expression is noted in both the MCF-7 VP-16 and AdVp3000 sublines. Northern blot, immunoblot and immunohistochemistry analysis The expression of MXR was ascertained both at the gene level by northern blot (Fig. 2A), and at the protein level by immunoblotting with the MXR-specific polyclonal antibody 87405 (Fig. 2B) and by immunohistochemistry (Fig. 2C). High expression of MXR mRNA was observed only in the S1-M1- Mitoxantrone accumulation Fig. 3 shows the steady state accumulation of 20 nM [3H]mitoxantrone in wild-type (S1 and MCF-7) and mitoxantrone-resistant (S1-M1-80 and MCF-7 AdVp3000) cells. In both of the latter cell lines, the intracellular mitoxantrone levels were significantly lower (50% and 40%, respectively) than in wild type. This mitoxantrone accumulation defect was more thoroughly investigated by confocal microscopy, a study we extended to include a range of fluorescent drugs in order to define the substrate specificity of the putative new mechanism of drug resistance. Steady state fluorescent drug distribution Fig. 4 displays photomicrographs obtained by confocal microscopy of the steady state levels and localization of twelve drugs in the panel of six cell lines. Fig. 4A-I shows the distribution patterns of mitoxantrone (Fig. 4A) and seven other known P-gp substrates: daunorubicin (Fig. 4C), bisantrene (Fig. 4D), topotecan (Fig. 4E), rhodamine 123 (Fig. 4F), and fluorescent BODIPY derivatives of prazosin (Fig. 4G), vinblastine (Fig. 4H) and paclitaxel (Fig. 4I). Following incubation for 60 minutes at 37°C, the drug-sensitive parental cells (S1 and MCF-7) had the highest intracellular drug levels and intense nuclear staining with mitoxantrone (Fig. 4A) and daunorubicin (Fig. 4C). Mitoxantrone levels were decreased in the P-gp-overexpressing S1-B1-20 cells and strikingly decreased in the two mitoxantrone-resistant lines, S1-M1-80 and MCF-7 AdVp3000 (Fig. 4A). Fig. 4B shows that pretreatment with azide (15 mM) and deoxyglucose (50 mM) to deplete the cells of energy during mitoxantrone loading increases the level of mitoxantrone in the resistant sublines to that of the wild-type cells. Although not shown here, returning the cells to glucosecontaining medium restores efflux and mitoxantrone levels in the examined substrates for MRP. P-gp is known to efflux the nonfluorescent calcein-AM ester (Homolya et al., 1994). Once inside the cell, the AM ester group is cleaved by intracellular esterases; the resulting calcein is fluorescent and has been shown to be a transport substrate for MRP but not for P-gp (Versantvoort et al., 1995). Consistent with this, the P-gpexpressing S1-B1-20 cells, as well as the MRP-overexpressing MCF-7 VP-16 cells, were characterized by their very low and vesicular calcein accumulation (Fig. 4K). The UV-excitable compound monochlorobimane becomes fluorescent when bound to glutathione, and has been used to assess intracellular glutathione levels (Millis et al., 1997; van Luyn et al., 1998). We found that the steady state level of glutathione-bound monochlorobimane was lower only in the MRP-overexpressing MCF-7 VP-16 cells (data not shown), an observation which is compatible with the suggested role of MRP as a glutathione Sconjugate pump (Zhang and Wong, 1996). The MXRexpressing cells showed no evidence of transport of either calcein or of glutathione-conjugated monochlorobimane (data not shown). Finally, the distribution of three organelle-specific probes was examined: a fluorescent BODIPY derivative of Brefeldin A, which labels the endoplasmatic reticulum, BODIPY FL C5-ceramide, a selective stain of the trans-Golgi network (Schindler et al., 1996; Demaurex et al., 1998), and LysoTracker Green, a weak base that will accumulate in acidic compartments such as lysosomes, due to trapping of the protonated and thus membrane-impermeable form of the dye (Haugland, 1996). All cell lines showed intense labeling of the ER with BODIPY Brefeldin A (data not shown). Five out of the six cell lines showed clear staining of the trans-Golgi with BODIPY FL C5-ceramide, the one exception being MCF-7 AdVp3000 (Fig. 4L), which showed only very faint fluorescence, suggesting that BODIPY FL C5-ceramide may be a substrate for the putative membrane transporter present in this cell line. A striking result was seen in S1-M1-80 cells in which the fluorescence emission of BODIPY FL C5-ceramide was strongly red-shifted, indicating a high local concentration of the dye in the Golgi of these cells. The acidic organelle probe LysoTracker Green (Fig. 7B) revealed an acidic compartment in all of the cell lines, again except for the MCF-7 AdVp3000 cells, as these seemed to efflux the dye rapidly. Mitoxantrone accumulation in MXR transfectants To confirm that MXR alone could mediate the drug resistance phenotype described above, we examined mitoxantrone accumulation by confocal microscopy in cell lines transfected with the half-transporter. Since MXR, BCRP and ABCP1 represent the same gene, we utilized the BCRP stable transfectants previously described (Doyle et al., 1998). Fig. 6 shows confocal microscopy micrographs of the steady state level of mitoxantrone in MXR transfectants. Drugsensitive MCF-7 cells, which have been transfected with fulllength MXR cDNA (clone 8), accumulate less mitoxantrone than control cells (vector) transfected with the vector alone. This directly proves that functional expression of MXR mediates mitoxantrone resistance. Intracellular localization of mitoxantrone Colocalization studies with mitoxantrone and the above probes for intracellular compartments were performed to investigate whether sequestration plays a role in any of the resistance phenotypes, as suggested by Dietel et al. (1990) for the mitoxantrone-resistant carcinoma cell line EPG85-257. The green fluorescence of the lysosomal probe LysoTracker Green (Fig. 7B) was overlaid with the red emission signal of mitoxantrone (Fig. 7A) to obtain the composite images, where 2018 yellow indicates colocalization of mitoxantrone with the lysosomal marker (Fig. 7C). It appears that mitoxantrone normally accumulates in acidic vesicles in most cell types, as suggested by its colocalization with LysoTracker Green (Fig. 7C). The S1 cells displayed the most intense staining. This vesicular staining pattern persisted in S1-M1-80 cells, but the overall level of accumulation was reduced. It was not possible to see colocalization in MCF-7 AdVp3000 cells, due to marked efflux of both compounds. Similar results were obtained with daunorubicin (data not shown). Compartmentalization of drugs may thus represent an intrinsic protective mechanism upon which the drug efflux mechanism highly expressed in S1-M1- 80 and MCF-7 AdVp3000 cells has been superimposed. DISCUSSION This report presents a comprehensive examination of the resistance phenotype of human colon (S1-M1-80) and breast (MCF-7 AdVp3000) cancer cells, which overexpress the mitoxantrone resistance associated gene MXR [GenBank accession numbers: AF093771 (MXR1) and AF093772 (MXR2)]. We recently identified MXR as an ABC halftransporter with strong homology to the Drosophila white gene product (Miyake et al., 1999). MXR is a member of the ABC superfamily of membrane transporters (Leveille- Webster and Arias, 1995; Higgins, 1992), one of the largest protein superfamilies known. This family comprises hundreds of members in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms, most of which function as ATP-dependent active membrane transporters, translocating molecules across a cell membrane against a concentration gradient (Dean and Allikmets, 1995). While P-gp is the most well-characterized ABC transporter, in recent years new members of the ABC superfamily (Allikmets et al., 1996), such as MRP1 (Cole et al., 1992), MRP2 (cMOAT) (Elferink and Jansen, 1994), MRP6 (also known as ARA, anthracycline resistance associated protein) (Longhurst et al., 1996), MOAT-B (Lee et al., 1998), and BCRP (breast cancer resistance protein) (Doyle et al., 1998) have also been associated with drug resistance. The only slight variation of MXR from the ABCP1 (Allikmets et al., 1998) and BCRP (Doyle et al., 1998) genes indicates that the three are indeed the same gene. Our goal in these studies was to characterize the phenotype of this newly described transporter. Despite the different selection history of the S1-M1-80 and the MCF-7 AdVp3000 cell lines, a similar phenotype is displayed. First, the cross-resistance patterns seem to be almost identical for MCF-7 AdVp3000 and S1-M1-80 cells (Table 2), both having a high level of resistance to mitoxantrone, the anthracyclines and topotecan. Second, as visualized by confocal microscopy, there are similar intracellular drug distribution profiles, with reduced mitoxantrone, daunorubicin, bisantrene, topotecan, BODIPY-prazocin and rhodamine 123 accumulation. Neither the tubulin binding agents paclitaxel and vinblastine, nor the MRP substrate calcein, appear to be substrates, distinguishing the MXR resistance mechanism from that of both P-gp and MRP. Third, the mitoxantrone resistance correlated with that of an energy-dependent accumulation defect in both sublines. This was shown by restoration of mitoxantrone accumulation to the level in sensitive, parental cells after preincubation with azide (15 mM) and deoxyglucose (50 mM). Efflux of mitoxantrone after restoration of energy was higher from the resistant cells than from the parental cell lines, extending previous findings of energydependent rhodamine efflux in these cells (Lee et al., 1997). It was recently shown that transfection of the BCRP gene conferred mitoxantrone resistance to parental MCF-7 cells, further confirming BCRP/MXR as the mechanism of resistance in these cells (Doyle et al., 1998). Extending that observation, we also demonstrate that these cells exhibit decreased mitoxantrone accumulation as compared to control cells transfected with the vector alone. Furthermore, in preliminary studies we have observed that transient transfection with MXR confers efflux of both rhodamine 123 and daunorubicin (data not shown). Since the MCF-7 AdVp3000 and S1-M1-80 cells overexpress MXR at high levels, we conclude that the displayed phenotype represents that of the product of the halftransporter gene. These studies suggest that overexpression of the MXR protein may allow homodimerization to form a functional transporter. Neither the mechanism of transport by MXR nor its role in normal physiology is known. Considering that halftransporters are typically found on intracellular membranes (Townsend and Trowsdale, 1993), it can be speculated that MXR might reside on the endoplasmatic reticulum to facilitate drug metabolism. Indeed, glucuronidation of anticancer drugs such as mitoxantrone, the anthracyclines and SN-38 has been reported to occur in tumor cells (Burchell et al., 1991; Takahashi et al., 1997), and in our laboratory we have further demonstrated that MXR-expressing cells are capable of glucuronidating cytotoxic drugs (Brangi et al., 2000). In such a model, which requires experimental validation, the metabolite would require transport out of the ER, a potential physiologic role for MXR. In the case of the very high expression levels found in drug-resistant MCF-7 AdVp3000 cells the excess protein might redistribute to the plasma membrane. Indeed, by immunohistochemical analysis of MXR protein expression, we have observed both cytoplasmic and T.

COL, DOX and EPI results also obtained by confocal microscopy (data not shown). (Miyake et al., 1999). Some compounds, including the lysosomal probe, LysoTracker Green, and the trans-Golgi probe, BODIPY FL C5-ceramide, appear to be better substrates for MCF-7 AdVp3000 than for S1-M1-80, as these dyes are practically eliminated from MCF-7 AdVp3000 cells. However, the possibility exists that the S1-M1-80 cells accumulate substrates into a vesicular compartment, as suggested by the BODIPY FL C5-ceramide data, rather than solely eliminating the probe from the plasma membrane. These differences may be related to the protein level, which is significantly higher in MCF-7 AdVp3000 than in S1-M1- 80, as seen by immunoblot. A second possibility is that the MXR may be more efficiently located, e.g. in the plasma membrane in the MCF-7 AdVp3000 breast cancer cells. This differential localization would be analogous to the redistribution of MRP that has previously been described (Almquist et al., 1995). A third possibility is that the tenfold overexpression of MRP2 in MCF-7 AdVp3000 cells could account for the additional substrates. The same level of MRP2 overexpression is, however, found in MCF-7 VP-16 cells, which do not eliminate the noted compounds. Finally, it is possible that a difference in dimerization may confer a difference in transport efficiency for a particular compound. As a half-transporter, MXR should require dimerization in order to transport substrates. MXR may exist as a homodimer in the MCF-7 AdVp3000 cells in which the MXR gene is amplified, while it may form hetero-dimers with a hitherto unidentified partner in the S1-M1-80 cells, which do not show amplification of the MXR gene (Miyake et al., 1999). Whether homo- or hetero-dimers of MXR exist remains to be investigated. compartmentalization, since it has been suggested that sequestration of mitoxantrone into membrane vesicles can contribute to drug resistance (Dietel et al., 1990; Fox and Smith, 1995). While a detailed examination of this question is beyond the scope of this paper, we noted cytoplasmic, mitoxantronecontaining vesicles in all the colon carcinoma (S1) cells. In the S1-M1-80 cells, colocalization studies indicated that the drug accumulated in acidic vesicles, the morphology of which did not appear to be different between the three colon cell lines. Although intracellular sequestration may play a role in intrinsic resistance to mitoxantrone, and may be a mechanism by which unselected cells dispose of the drug, this mechanism appears to be superceded by the MXR overexpression, which results in a profound drug accumulation defect. The mitoxantrone accumulation defect as assessed by confocal microscopy seemed greater than that observed by accumulation of radioactive mitoxantrone. This could be due to the greater sensitivity of the radioactive method. Alternatively, the data could be explained by intracellular metabolism of mitoxantrone (Ehninger et al., 1990). Taking normal hepatic metabolism as a model, mitoxantrone is subject to glucuronidation (Wolf et al., 1986; Burchell et al., 1991; Blanz et al., 1991a), glutathione conjugation (Peters and Roelofs, 1992; Rekha and Sladek, 1997; Blanz et al., 1991b), or oxidation to its mono- or dicarboxylic acid derivatives (Richard et al., 1991). The latter primary metabolites of mitoxantrone are non-fluorescent (Bell, 1988) and would not be detectable by fluorescence microscopy. Thus, metabolism to an inactive metabolite prior to efflux in drug-resistant cells would be expected to result in a decrease in fluorescence emission, while not affecting the signal, in a study in which accumulation of radioactive mitoxantrone is measured. This could explain discrepancies in the literature on mitoxantroneresistant cell lines, some studies reporting little or no decrease in intracellular mitoxantrone accumulation (Harker et al., 1989; Dalton et al., 1988; Bailly et al., 1997), with others reporting increased mitoxantrone efflux and a marked decrease in intracellular drug accumulation (Lee et al., 1997; Kellner et al., 1997; Taylor et al., 1991). The fact that multiple transporters can affect individual anticancer agents has significant implications for studies attempting reversal of drug resistance. The anthracyclines, for example, are substrates for P-gp, MRP and MXR. Inhibition of one transporter may be thwarted by the presence of another. This observation is consistent with the profound drug resistance often found in clinical oncology and may explain why drug reversal trials in the clinic have not achieved dramatic results (Sandor et al., 1998; Tew, 1993). It is altogether likely that resistance mechanisms may yet encompass new, hitherto unidentified or uncharacterized members of the ABC superfamily (Allikmets et al., 1996; Ling, 1997; Müller, 1999). This further underscores both the complexity of multidrug resistance and the need for development of new and better reversers of clinical drug resistance.

23	2016	Overcoming ABC transporter-mediated multidrug resistance: Molecular mechanisms and novel therapeutic drug strategies	a b s t r a c t Multidrug resistance is a key determinant of cancer chemotherapy failure. One of the major causes of multidrug resistance is the enhanced efflux of drugs by membrane ABC transporters. Targeting ABC transporters projects a promising approach to eliminating or suppressing drug resistance in cancer treatment. To reveal the functional mechanisms of ABC transporters in drug resistance, extensive studies have been conducted from identifying drug binding sites to elucidating structural dynamics. In this review article, we examined the recent crystal structures of ABC proteins to depict the functionally important structural elements, such as domains, conserved motifs, and critical amino acids that are involved in ATP-binding and drug efflux. We inspected the drug-binding sites on ABC proteins and the molecular mechanisms of various substrate interactions with the drug binding pocket. While our continuous battle against drug resistance is far from over, new approaches and technologies have emerged to push forward our frontier. Most recent developments in anti-MDR strategies include P-gp inhibitors, RNA-interference, nano-medicines, and delivering combination strategies. With the advent of the ‘Omics’ era – genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics – these disciplines play an important role in fighting the battle against chemoresistance by further unraveling the molecular mechanisms of drug resistance and shed light on medical therapies that specifically target MDR.  Multidrug resistance (MDR) is one of the major clinical impediments in cancer chemotherapy and treatment of infectious diseases. Nearly 80% of patients develop drug resistance in hospital settings, leading healthcare cost to skyrocket (Wang, 2014). Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that more than two million people are diagnosed with serious infectious diseases every year due to antibiotic resistance and about 20,000 people die due to failure of treatment (Prevention, 2015). Some life-threatening pathogens such as HIV, herpes simplex virus, and influenza are becoming increasingly resistant and difficult to treat. Cancer cells that are originally sensitive to a single anti-cancer drug later become resistant to multiple anti-cancer drugs. Although a combination of drugs may effectively direct cancer cells toward apoptosis, this approach frequently results in undesired toxicity. MDR can be caused by several mechanisms, such as reduced uptake of drugs, altered cell cycle checkpoint and cell cycle arrest, altered drug target, increased efflux of drugs by drug transporters, and sequestration of anticancer drugs in lysosomes as well as in intracellular organelles and intercellular vesicles (Chai et al., 2010; Goler-Baron and Assaraf, 2011; Goler-Baron et al., 2012; Gonen and Assaraf, 2012; Ifergan et al., 2005; Lebedeva et al., 2012; Livney and Assaraf, 2013;Raz et al., 2014; Zhitomirsky andAssaraf, 2015, 2016; Zhou et al., 2015). In cancer cells, the predominant cause of MDR is the increased efflux of anti-cancer drugs by membrane-embedded drug transporters. The most well-studied drug transporters in humans is P-glycoprotein (P-gp/MDR1/ABCB1), which belongs to the ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC) superfamily (Ferry et al., 1992; Gottesman and Pastan, 1993; Rosenberg et al., 1997). Other well studiedABC drug transporters include multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1/ABCC1) (Muller et al., 1996), breast cancer resistant protein (BCRP/MXR/ABCP/ABCG2)(Bram et al., 2007; Bram et al., 2009; Kawabata et al., 2001; Lage and Dietel, 2000; Shafran et al., 2005) from human and bacterial homologues such as LmrA from Lactococcus lactis (Federici et al., 2007; van den Berg van Saparoea et al., 2005), DrrAB doxorubicin transporter from Streptomyces peucetius (Li, 2014; Li et al., 2013a, 2014b; Pradhan et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2015b), macrolide antibiotics transporter MacB (Kobayashi et al., 2003; Piao et al., 2008), and MsbA from E. coli (Doerrler and Raetz, 2002; Schmitt, 2002). In the present review article, we first present a systematic overview of the crystal structure, functional mechanism, and dynamic drug binding features of several ABC drug transporters. Using different models, we also describe how the energy transduction, triggered by ATP binding, promotes drug efflux to the extracellular milieu. Several advanced technologies to combat MDR are presented and discussed with real case studies. The current knowledge of MDR in cancer that we present in the current review article will benefit the clinical therapies and drug development in the future. 2. MDR and ABC drug transporters 2.1. ABC drug transporters To date, at least 15 human ABC proteins, such as P-gp, MRP1, and BCRP, have been found to mediate MDR as drug efflux pumps. However, several recent studies reported that, besides drug efflux, these ABC proteins may further extend their role through other mechanisms (Breier et al., 2013; Videira et al., 2014). For example, an observed decrease in sensitivity to therapeutic substances (such as cisplatin) that are not P-gp substrates in P-gp-overexpressing tumor cells suggested that ABC transporters may play additional roles in regulatory pathways (Shen et al., 2012). Newly discovered roles of ABC transporters include: (1) modifying the distribution of ABC transporters to intracellular (e.g., cytoplasmic vesicles) or extracellular (e.g., exosomes which enable the transformation of drug-sensitive cells to drug-resistant cells) compartments to further improve the efficiency of drug sequestration (Goler-Baron and Assaraf, 2011; Horio et al., 1988); (2) involvement in tumor cell proliferation, invasion, and defense against anti-tumor regulatory pathways, such as deregulating and inhibiting the apoptotic pathways and complement-mediated cytotoxicity (Pallis and Russell, 2000; Weisburg et al., 1999; Zhang et al., 2014). Both prokaryotes and eukaryotes share the minimal structure requirement of highly conserved nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) and variable transmembrane domains (TMDs) of ABC proteins. Some ABC proteins exhibit these domains within a single polypeptide chain (P-gp) (Ambudkar et al., 1999), while others may be assembled from two homodimeric (DrrAB) (Kaur et al., 2005) or heterodimeric polypeptide chains (LmrCD)(Kast et al., 1995; Lubelski et al., 2006; Tusnady et al., 1997). P-glycoprotein, also known as ABCB1, is encoded by a single polypeptide chain with two homologous NBDs and two homologous TMDs (Ambudkar et al., 1999; Ferry et al., 1992). The two NBDs contain conserved motifs such as Walker A, Walker B, ABC signature, a glutamine loop (Q-loop), and a switch motif (Davidson et al., 2008; Sharom, 2011). These motifs form a large pocket for ATPbinding and hydrolysis, and it is generally believed that both NBDs are requiredfornormalATPase activity anddrug transportfunction. However, it has been reported that NBD2 is partially dispensable for channel activity in mammalian CFTR (Cui et al., 2007), while ATP binding and hydrolysis may occur at two NBDs alternatively (Senior et al., 1995). P-gp consists of a single polypeptide with two NBDs and two TMDs. Each TMD contains six transmembrane helices (TMH) 2.2. Structures of ABC transporters The first high resolution structure of ABC proteins was obtained from the NBD domain of HisP from Salmonella typhimurium (Hung et al., 1998). Subsequently, the crystal structure of the vitamin B12 transporter BtuCD from E.coli was determined at a resolution of 3.2A˚ (Locher and Borths, 2004; Locher et al., 2002). The BtuCD complex (90A˚ × 60A˚ × 30A)˚ contains two copies of NBDs (BtuD) and two copies of TMDs (BtuC). The NBDs sit directly below the membrane connecting to the TMDs. The TMDs with 10 -helices on each subunit form a flexible cavity structure and translocate the substrate by alternatively opening or closing its cavity to either the periplasmic or cytoplasmic sides (Locher and Borths, 2004; Locher et al., 2002). MsbA is a half transporter with lipid flippase activity. It contains a single TMD fused to an NBD. The crystal structure of MsbA was initially obtained in 2001 (Chang and Roth, 2001), although a more accurate structure with higher resolution was not obtained until 2007 (Ward et al., 2007). Fig. 2A represents the updated structure of MsbA from Salmonella typhimurium in a closed-apo form. In this structure, the two pairs of TMD/NBD subunits are connected with each other through a -helix linker. The whole complex forms an open ‘V’ shape structure with a distance of approximately 50A. ˚ Cross-linking experiments and Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy studies indicated that MsbA can form a large and flexible chamber facing the cytoplasmic region to allow for the flipping of large molecules such as lipid A or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from the cytoplasm to the exterior (Ward et al., 2007). In 1997, Rosenberg et al., reported a low resolution (2.5 nm) structure of P-gp using electron microscopy (EM) single particle image analysis of a purified protein (Rosenberg et al., 1997). The protein was found to form a six-fold symmetric toroid with a diameter of 10 nm. However, a higher resolution crystal structure of P-gp was subsequently obtained by Aller et al. (2009). This structure was based on nucleotide-free inward facing conformation with a resolution of 3.8A. ˚ The two NBDs with 6 transmembrane helices on each domain were separated by ∼30A. ˚ They formed a large internal cavity of ∼6000A˚ 3 that can accommodate atleasttwo substrates simultaneously (Loo et al., 2003a). The drug binding pocket mainly consists of hydrophobic and aromatic residues, indicating its preferential binding to polyspecific substrates and lipids (Aller et al., 2009). A more refined crystal structure of P-gp was later obtained by the same group in 2014 using de novo model building of selected regions (Li et al., 2014a). With a resolution of 3.8A˚ (Fig. 3A),thenewmodel exhibited amore refined proteingeometry, with more residues observed in favorable Ramachandran region as well as corrected amino acid residues in drug binding sites. By using Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) analysis, it was shown that the cysteine residue in the signature sequence (427GNSGCGKS434) of one Walker A motif could cross-link with the cysteine on the other Walker A motif (1070GSSGCGKS1077) in close proximity with the residues of a downstream 1176LSGGQ1180 motif (Loo et al., 2002; Qu and Sharom, 2001; Urbatsch et al., 2001). This interaction indicated that the two ATP-binding sites participate in formation of the ATP-binding pocket, and their interactions are essential for coupling ATP hydrolysis to drug transport. The close view ofthese conserved motifs in both MsbA(PDB code: 3B60, AMPPNP-bound) and P-gp (PDB code: 4M1M, open-apo form) . Energy transduction of drug efflux mediated by ABC transporters The biochemical and biophysical bases of energy transduction of drug efflux mediated by ABC transporters remain controversial subjects, mainly due to the discrepancies between the two major mechanistic models proposed to describe these processes: the “ATP switch” model, and the “reciprocating twin-channel” model. Energy transduction takes place during the overall drug efflux, including ATP catalysis (which occurs in NBDs and can be further dissected into ATP-binding and occlusion, ATP-hydrolysis, and ADP-Pi release) and the drug transport cycle (which occurs in TMDs where substrate binding, translocation from inner to outer leaflet, and drug release takes place). Therefore, the objective of these models is to explain how drug translocation is delicately coupled with ATP hydrolysis, by addressing the following key questions: (1) the sequence of these steps; (2) conformational changes induced by each step; and (3) how these signals are communicated to the physical locations of subsequent events. In the ATP switch model, it has been proposed that drug/substrate binding to the inward facing side of the TMD promotes the switch oftwo NBDs from the “open” to the “closed” dimer 2.4. Drug binding to P-gp P-gp is able to interact with hundreds of structurally diverse chemical compounds, including anticancer drugs, fluorescent dyes, steroid hormones, hydrophobic toxic peptides and lipids (Assaraf and Borgnia, 1994; Borgnia et al., 1996; Eytan et al., 1994; Ma et al., 2015; Shapiro and Ling, 1998; Sharma et al., 1992). It is still unclear whether or not P-gp contains a single large drug binding site ormultiple sites. In 1997, Shapiro and Ling identified two drug binding sites on P-gp, an H-site that preferentially interacts with Hoechst 33342 and the R-site observed to interact with Rhodamine 123 and anthracyclines (Shapiro and Ling, 1997). Later, a third drugbinding site with a positive allosteric effect on H and R sites was identified (Shapiro et al., 1999). In a subsequent related study, Martin et al., reported the use of equilibrium and kinetic radio-ligand binding assays to identify at least four distinct drug interaction sites on P-gp (Martin et al., 2000). Additionally, Loo and Clarke used a combination of cysteine-scanning mutagenesis and thiolmodification techniques to identify specific residues involved in drug binding on P-gp (Loo and Clarke, 2001, 1999a, 1997, 2000; Loo and Clarke, 2002). A list of residues within the transmembrane region of membrane-embedded P-gp which affect substrate- binding and transport were highlighted in Fig. 4B and listed in Fig. 4C. Residues in TM 4, 5, 6 in TMD1 and TM 9, 10, 11, 12 in TMD2 are mainly involved in the formation ofthe drug binding pocket. Nearly 18% of amino acids involved in drug-binding are aromatic residues (Loo and Clarke, 1999b). With a highly flexible drug-binding pocket, multiple chemical compounds can bind to P-gp simultaneously. For instance, verapamil and TMEA can bind to the different regions of the shared drug-binding pocket of P-gp (Loo et al., 2003a). Fluorescence studies indicated that both LDS-751 and R123 can bind to the R-site of P-gp simultaneously and interact with each other in a non-competitive manner (Lugo and Sharom, 2005). In another study, mutation of residues that form hydrogen bonds with P-gp inhibitors caused reversal of the inhibitors, resulting in their stimulatory effect on ATP binding and hydrolysis (Chufan et al., 2016). Moreover, cysteine cross-linking assays revealed that the packing of TM segments of P-gp was different for each substrate, and this “induced-fit” type mechanism can explain how the binding pocket accommodates such a broad range of structurally diverse compounds (Loo et al., 2003b). 3. MDR transport inhibitors To date, P-gp has proven to be able to interact with >200 structurally unrelated chemical compounds that are classified as substrates and modulators (Didziapetris et al., 2003). Various substrates can be directly transported by P-gp, including anthracyclines, Vinca alkaloids, and fluorescent lipids (Higgins and Gottesman, 1992; van Helvoort et al., 1996). Modulators such as verapamil and cyclosporine A can bind and block the transport function of the transporter, which presents significant clinical applications in cancer chemotherapy (Dong et al., 1996; Shukla et al., 2012; Tinsley et al., 2010). P-gp contains a large flexible drug-binding pocket with low specificity; development of more specific, potent inhibitors/modulators are urgently needed to overcome MDR. Generally, inhibitors/modulators capable of reversing MDR can be divided into three generations (Kathawala et al., 2015), as summarized below, and a list of frequently used anti-cancer drugs are summarized in Table 1. 3.1. First generation MDR transporter inhibitors In 1981, Tsuruo’s group discovered that verapamil could reverse the profile of drug resistance in leukemia cells (Tsuruo et al., 1981). However, to acquire effective inhibition of MDR, patients received high dosages that could result in serious cardiovascular toxicity (Pennock et al., 1991). Other examples of early discovery of inhibitors/modulators include cyclosporine A, trifluoperazine, quinidine, and progesterone (Kelly et al., 2011). Due to low therapeutic response and high celltoxicity,these inhibitors were quickly replaced by a second generation of inhibitors (Bechtel et al., 2008; Koski et al., 2012; Thomas and Coley, 2003). 3.2. Second generation MDR transporter inhibitors The second generation inhibitors were designed by structurally modifying the first generation inhibitors in order to acquire higher potency, specificity, and low celltoxicity. Examples include dexverapamil (Wilson et al., 1995), valspodar (PSC 833) (Tidefelt et al., 2000), and biricodar citrate (VX-710) (Minderman et al., 2004). PSC833 is the most frequently used inhibitor with a potency 5–10 times that of cyclosporine A (Friche et al., 1992). However, these transport inhibitors of P-gp are also frequently inhibitors of cytochrome P450, and therefore, may cause drug-drug interactions with concomitant anticancer drugs (Gottesman et al., 2006; Kathawala et al., 2015; Leonard et al., 2003). 3.3. Third generation MDR transporter inhibitors Continuous problems withMDRhave driven the development of  Drug binding site of the P-gp in open apo form. (A) Inward-facing conformation of P-gp with drug binding residues highlighted with red or blue color. Green represents and N-terminal half and yellow represents the C terminal half of P-gp, red represents drug binding residues at the N-terminal half and blue represents drug binding residues at the C-terminal half of P-gp; (B) closer view of the drug binding sites at the transmembrane domain of P-gp; (C) list of drug binding residues and their binding substrates. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of the article.) idarubicin, mitoxantrone, and mylotarg in acute myeloid leukemia (Tang et al., 2008). Recently, studies using QSAR and 3D-QSAR analyses have found that the structures of modulators are the main determinants of their inhibitory function. Results of a comprehensive study of 32 anthranilamide derivatives of tariquidar indicated that a hydrophobic domain is required for the inhibitory function, which includes a large aromatic ring system and a heteroatom near the anthranilamide nucleus at the other end of the tetrahydroquinoline group (Pajeva and Wiese, 2009). However, although tariquidar has been evaluated in clinical trials as a potent P-gp inhibitor, recent studies showed that tariquidar is both a substrate and an inhibitor of P-gp depending on its in vivo dosage (Kannan et al., 2011). Several tariquidar analogs, aiming to have higher potency and better stability than tariquidar, was characterized using 3D-QSAR (three dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship) and contour map analysis (Kakarla et al., 2016). 3.4. Natural compounds with a MDR reversal effect Natural compounds or plant extracts can be potent inhibitors of P-gp and they exhibit less cytotoxicity and better oral bioavailability. Polyphenolic compounds such as flavonoids or stilbenes extracted from Chinese herbal plants can reverse MDR caused by ABC drug transporters in vitro (Michalak and Wesolowska, 2012). Neochamaejasmin B (NCB) extracted from the root of Stellerachamaejasme L. has been widely used as a traditional Chinese medicine due to its antitumor, antivirus, and antibacterial activities. RT-PCR and Western blot analyses have shown that NCB could suppress the expression of P-gp and inhibit P-gp-mediated drug efflux in a dose-dependent manner (Pan et al., 2015). Some natural compounds such as cytarabine, trabectedin, and halaven have also been approved for clinical use, based on their strong MDR reversal activity (Abraham et al., 2010; Huang et al., 2014; Lopez and Martinez-Luis, 2014; Shi et al., 2007). 3.5. Small molecules from versatile scaffolds A library of small molecules containing different scaffolds, such as tetralin, furoxane, and biphenyl, were designed to inhibit P-gp efflux activity. In vitro assays and in vivo PET studies proved that co-administration of these novel molecules with anticancer drugs could increase the pharmacological activities of anticancer drugs (Zinzi et al., 2014). Although co-administration of P-gp inhibitors/modulators with anti-cancer drugs may effectively 4. Novel strategies to overcome MDR in cancer cells To solve these problems, novel strategies to overcome MDR in cancer cells are being developed using biochemical and physical methods as well as nanotechnologies (2014; Livney and Assaraf, 2013; Shapira et al., 2012; Tiram et al., 2016). 4.1. Inactivation of MDR-associated genes by microRNA and RNA interference MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that bind to the 3 UTR of mRNA and inhibit the expression of protein at the translational level (Li et al., 2012b; Shen et al., 2013). MicroRNAs are generally dysregulated in cancer cells, and alterations in miRNA levels may contribute to the development of MDR (To, 2013). For instance, a series of miRNAs (miR-27a,-451, -296, -298, -1253) were identified to inhibit the expression of P-gp, and their chemotherapeutic effects were evaluated in MCF-7 breast cancer cells and esophageal squamous carcinoma cells (Bao et al., 2012; Hong et al., 2010; Zhu et al., 2008). To systematically understand how regulation of miRNAs could contribute to the development of drug resistance, deep miRNAs sequencing of vincristine sensitive and -resistant colon cancer cells were performed (Dong et al., 2015). Out of 24 miRNAs showing significant differences, 17 were upregulated in drug resistant cells. These miRNAs could be used as unique biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and treatment. Synthetic siRNAs are also extensively used to reverse chemoresistance by inhibiting the expression of MDR genes, such as ABCB1 (MDR1), ABCB4 (MDR3), BCRP (Fisher et al., 2007; Li et al., 2012a; Perez et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2003). An example is the reduced expression level of ABCC4 using RNA interference in drugresistant gastric cancer cells. This inhibition resulted in an effective inhibition of cell proliferation, and increased cell sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs (Zhang et al., 2015a). 4.2. Monoclonal antibodies targeting P-gp In the 1980s, two monoclonal antibodies targeting P-gp, MRK16 and MRK-17, were developed to effectively reverse drug resistance mediated by P-gp both in vivo and in vitro (Broxterman et al., 1988; Hamada and Tsuruo, 1986; Pearson et al., 1991; Tsuruo et al., 1989). MRK-16 blocked actinomycin D and vincristine efflux, while MRK-17 inhibited the proliferation of MDR cells. Later in 1992, Roninson et al., designed a mouse monoclonal antibody UIC2 which specifically binds to a cell surface epitope of P-gp. Itinhibited the drug efflux activity of P-gp and enhanced cellular cytotoxicity (Mechetner and Roninson, 1992). Monoclonal antibodies in conjugation with P-gp-reversing agents can enhance anti-cancer activity. One example is the study from the Naito’s group; the combination of MRK-16 and cyclosporine A increased the chemosensitivity of MDR K562/ADM cells to vincristine and doxorubicin, leading to an enhanced anti-tumor activity than monotreatment ofthe cells with vincristine and doxorubicin alone (Naito et al., 1993). MRK-16 is currently being evaluated in clinical phase I trials. 4.3. Development of novel anticancer drugs that are not P-gp substrates As many anti-tumor agents including the first and the second generation inhibitors of P-gp, are also substrates of the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 3A4, competition between these P-gp modulators and this cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 3A4 can cause seriously toxic pharmacokinetic interactions (Thomas and Coley, 2003). Therefore, new anticancer drugs that are not recognized by P-gp and/or other ABC transporters are being developed. For example, taxane analogs DJ-927 (Shionoya et al., 2003), BMS-184476 (Altstadt et al., 2001), and ortataxel (Cassinelli et al., 2002) are not substrates of P-gp. These drugs have been evaluated in clinical trials for their MDR evasion activity in both sensitive and MDR tumor cell lines. Likewise, indirubin, a Chinese traditional medicine, is not transported by P-gp, but may significantly inhibit the efflux of doxorubicin and vincristine by P-gp (Su et al., 2012). 4.4. Nanotechnology-based approaches to overcome MDR Nanoparticles are used extensively to deliver anti-tumor, anti-infection, or anti-inflammation chemicals to specific target cells/tissues of patients. The size of NPs varies between 1 to several hundred nm. Examples of NPs include polymers, solid lipids, metals, quantum dots, dendrimers, liposomes, and micelles (BarZeev et al., 2016; Livney and Assaraf, 2013; Shapira et al., 2012; Sun et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2016; Zhang and Akbulut, 2011). These NPs can be assembled in multiple layers, and the surface coating is always the most crucial step for the specificity, stability, and solubility of these NPs (Cho et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2016). NPs loaded with anti-cancer drugs, P-gp inhibitors or RNAi molecules avoid problems associated with macromolecules, such as high dosage, cell toxicity, low specificity, cellular uptake, and intracellular delivery (Kapse-Mistry et al., 2014; Li et al., 2013b; Wen and Meng, 2014). A schematic overview of the internalization and delivery of drugs or miRNA loaded-NPs into drug-resistant cells is presented in Fig. 5. Compared to freely diffusing hydrophobic drugs, drug-loaded NPs have higher solubility, in vivo stability, increased specific biodistribution and better control of drug release (Kim et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2011). Moreover, combination of multiple anti-tumor components (such as anti-tumor drug and miRNA), as shown in Fig. 5, was shown to be a more efficient strategy in overcoming MDR (Gandhi et al., 2014; Kang et al., 2015). 4.4.1. Polymeric nanoparticles Bio-degradable polymeric NPs are the most commonly used nanovehicles for drug delivery. Polymers may be natural or synthetic. Frequently used natural polymers include gelatin, chitosan, and albumin. Commonly used bio-degradable synthetic polymers include poly (d,l-lactic acid) (PLA), poly(d,l-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), and poly (-caprolactone) (PLC) (Devulapally and Paulmurugan, 2014; Li et al., 2015). Various techniques have been used to form polymeric NPs, such as salting-out, dialysis, microemulsion, interfacial polymerization, solvent evaporation, and supercritical fluid technology (SCF) (Harsha, 2012). Co-polymers can be formed by combining different polymers, such 4.4.4. Mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNPs) Recently, mesoporous silica materials (MSNPS) have gained a great deal of attention due to their superior advantages for drug delivery, such as biocompatibility, large pore volume, high surface area, and tunable pore size. MSNPS have been used to load both siRNA and anticancer drugs simultaneously (Chen et al., 2009). Co-delivery of two types of anti-tumor molecules to cancer cell lines could effectively inhibit the expression of P-gp, thus greatly enhancing intracellular drug concentrations (Sheng et al., 2015). 4.4.5. Gold nanoparticles Gold NPs (AuNPs) have been investigated as suitable biomaterials for drug delivery. They can be easily synthesized and functionalized (Wu et al., 2010). In addition, they are non-toxic and biocompatible. The surface modification of gold NPs provides advantages of tumor targeting and controllable drug release (Wu et al., 2010; Yang et al., 2011). In addition, they can overcome the problem of MDR (Xu et al., 2006). For example, Lee et al., have designed Dox-PLGA-Au NPs with anti-DR4-antibody conjugated onto the Au surface. NPs-loaded tumor cells treated with near infrared (NIR) light for 10 min could reach an intracellular temperature of 45 ◦C. Highly effective reduction of tumor growth has been observed after hyperthermia. In addition, much lower dosage of doxorubicin is required to achieve the same effect of the chemotherapy (Lee et al., 2014). 4.5. Combinational strategies to overcome MDR Even though RNAi is capable of reversingMDR, effective delivery of RNA-interfering agents to the targeted cancer cells still remains challenging. To overcome this hurdle, Lage’s group delivered a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) into target cancer cells by TransKingdom RNAi (tkRNAi) (Kruhn et al., 2009; Lage and Kruhn, 2010). In tkRNAi, an expression vector TRIP is incorporated with the following four essential elements: the shRNA of interest, bacteriophage T7 promoter, Inv gene encoding invasion, and HlyA gene expressing listeriolysin O. TRIP is then incorporated into non-pathogenic bacteria and delivered into target cells to induce RNAi. This treatment showed approximately 45% inhibition of ABCB1 mRNA expression with ∼11-fold increase in drug accumulation in P-gp-dependent MDR cancer cells, compared to treatment with the drug alone (Kruhn et al., 2009). In another novel gene delivery system, RNAi was incorporated into NPs with anti-CD44 monoclonal antibody coated at the surface, forming a nano-complex named anti-CD44-P123-PPI. The CD44 monoclonal antibody, anchored at the surface of this nano-complex, could not only increase the transfection efficiency, but also lower the cytotoxicity. In vitro studies reported that an enhanced inhibition of MDR1/P-gp expression at both mRNA and protein levels was observed for this nano-complex than with traditional PPI/pDNA NPs (Gu et al., 2015a). Similarly, CD44-targeted NPs based on cholesteryl-hyaluronic acid (HA) conjugates have also been designed to deliver siRNA into MDR ovarian cancer cells with significantinhibitory effect on tumor growth, P-gp expression, and increased apoptosis in mice harboring MDR ovarian cancers (Yang et al., 2015). Rachur’s group designed a protamine and carboxymethyl cellulose polyelectrolyte multi-layered magnetic nanocapsules with Fe3O4 anchored at the surface. In the presence of a magnetic field,this magnetic nanocapsule loaded with doxorubicin showed enhanced cellular uptake of anti-cancer drugs with greater probability ofinducing apoptosis thanother cytotoxic drugs (Elumalai et al., 2015). Peptide self-assembly system is an emerging technology for the efficient delivery and retention of anti-cancer drugs or antibodies into cancer cells (Wen et al., 2013, 2014a,b; Zheng et al., 2011). By forming an amphiphilic environment by the peptides, hydrophobic anticancer drugs or antibodies were loaded onto the core through aromatic hydrophobic interactions (Sundar et al., 2014). The specificity of peptide-assembled nanostructures could be modulated by altering the peptide sequence on the surface; therefore efficient delivery and more than 120 h retention of immune-antibody in tumor cells were observed (Wen et al., 2013). In recent years, some basic structural components of plasma membranes, such as ceramide, sphingosines and caveolin, were shown to be involved in cancer MDR (Mitra et al., 2006; van Vlerken et al., 2007). For example, caveolin-1 is the major component of caveolae membrane coat which has been found to be essential for the ATPase activity and functionality of P-gp. Studies by Zhu et al. showed that overexpression of caveolin-1 results in the reduction of plasma membrane cholesterol levels, which further increases plasma membrane fluidity, thus blocking P-gp transport activity (Cai et al., 2004; Zhu et al., 2004). 5. Identification of novel MDR biomarkers using ‘Omics’ technologies The development of advanced genomics and proteomics technologies in the last decade significantly revolutionized the paradigm of drug target discovery in cancer chemotherapy (Li, 2015). Nowadays, deciphering the heterogeneous responses of each individual patient to anticancer drugs can be a major obstacle in clinical diagnostics and therapeutics (Liu et al., 2015b; Sheng et al., 2015). Precision oncology data from individual patients are required to determine the cause of cancer (Morrison et al., 2014). Rather than treating all the patients harboring a given malignancy with the same statistics-based protocol, personalized treatment modalities are required for each individual. This will not only increase the therapeutic efficacy, but also bring down the medical cost. Next generation sequencing (NGS) techniques allow the determination of the complete genomic profile of each individual or quantitatively sequencing hundreds of cancer-related genes in a few hours. The most commonly used NGS platforms include Illumina (Bentley et al., 2008; Fedurco et al., 2006; Turcatti et al., 2008), SMRT (Chhibber and Schroeder, 2008), SOLiD (Shendure et al., 2005), and Roche 454 (Margulies et al., 2005; Turcatti et al., 2008). Third generation sequencing platforms, aiming to avoid error of base-pairing during PCR, are currently under development. Examples of these include nanopore DNA sequencing (Stoddart et al., 2009) and mass spectrometry sequencing (Edwards et al., 2005). Novel anti-cancer drug targets or MDR biomarkers could be predicted by comparing the genetic mutation rate of high throughput genomic data from cancer patients. A set of small molecules and synthetic peptides or antibodies could be selected by computational analyses, such as SVM (Support Vector Machines), and the results can be validated experimentally (Jeon et al., 2014). For example, massive parallel sequencing was performed with hundreds of breast cancer samples in order to study the correlation between somatic mutations and breast cancer. Stephens et al.(143) reported somatic mutations in at least 40 cancer genes, including several new genes such asAKT2,ARID1B, CASP8, CDKN1B, MAP3K1, MAP3K13, NCOR1, SMARCD1, and TBX3 (Stephens et al., 2012). In the study of upregulated and down-regulated chemoresistance genes in ovarian clear cell carcinoma, NAPSA, GPX3 and ALDH1A1 were foundto be remarkably overexpressedintumor cells, andthey are now considered to be new biomarker candidates (Kobayashi et al., 2015). In another comprehensive data mining study, reliable biomarkers for both chemosensitive and chemoresistant tumor cells were identified by screening human tumor samples against a large range of drug responses that correlated with genomic variations (Sadanandam and Covell, 2015). Sensitivity to cisplatin in tumor cells is associated with mutations in EWS FLI1, PTEN, ERBB2, APC, XRCC1 and KRAS (Goel et al., 2012; Niedner et al., 2001; Xu et al., 2014). They also reported the global analysis of the CGP (Sanger Cancer Genomic Project) data, which described the genetic mutations, copy number variations and gene fusions related to 41 drugs’ responses. From the heatmap of drug-mutation combinations across allthe compounds tested in CGP database, CDKN2a.p14 mutation was found in a 24-drug response test, while a singlemutation was found in SMAD4, MDM2, EGFR and CDH1. These data indicated that geneticmutationsmay be shared across distinct anticancer drugs from different classes, and multiple genetic mutations may contribute to the variable response to drug treatment. While powerful sequencing technologies allow us to explore cancer biology from a genetic standpoint with better timeline and accuracy, they also have some challenges. For example, whole genome sequencing data have insufficient clinical annotation due to the existence of long non-coding RNA, intron–exon, repetitive sequences, and pseudogenes. Moreover, synonymous substitution neither results in a change of amino acid sequence of a protein, nor the structure ofthe protein. Epigenetic modifications may also contribute to the alteration of drug response pathways (Bird, 2007). Therefore, proteomics studies, aiming to identify the function of proteins at large scale both in quantity and quality, is crucial for pharmacological studies and personalized drug target discovery (Jain, 2002; Koomen et al., 2008). In the study of MDR in cancer cells, proteomics analysis can identify the difference in protein expression between drug sensitive and drug resistant tumor cells. In the comparative proteomics study of colon cancer stem cells, total proteins extracted from cells were digested into peptides and subjected to liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LS–MS). The LS–MS/MS spectral data was searched against human international protein index database using Sequest software. Out of 3048 proteins identified, 32 proteins were found to be up-regulated by at least 2-fold in cancer cells (Van Houdt et al., 2011); these proteins included glutathione peroxidase 2 (GPX2), ferritin (FTL), and RRS2 ribosome biogenesis regulator (RRS1). One of the most interesting up-regulated proteins was BIRC6. The latter belongs to the class of apoptotic protein inhibitors, and is critical in conferring anticancer drug resistance to cisplatin and oxaliplatin (Van Houdt et al., 2011). In another study on human ovarian cancer, isotope-coded affinity tag mass spectrometry (ICAT-MS) identified a total of 1117 proteins, from which 58 proteins were overexpressed in drug resistant cells (Van Houdt et al., 2011). Some proteins such as CASPR3, S100, and CDC42-binding protein kinase  may be involved in mechanisms of drug resistance (Stewart et al., 2006). 6. Conclusions and future perspectives Clinical evidence reveals that >90% of metastatic cancer patients face treatment failure due to drug resistance phenomena (Longley et al., 2006). Hence, MDR poses a major challenge to effective/successful chemotherapy in cancer treatment. As significant contributors that render cancer cell drug-resistance, ABC proteins belong to one of the largest protein superfamily that give researchers hope to unravel the molecular mechanism of drug resistance. Despite concentrated efforts made in better understanding MDR, it is still hampered by several impediments. Firstly, due to the instability of membrane protein in vitro, itis unfeasible to use a single type of purification method to extract all the subunits of the protein with native conformation. Most membrane proteins will be misfolded, degraded or aggregated without appropriate supply of detergents during the purification process. Secondly, the expression levels of MDR-related proteins may vary significantly; some proteins are expressed at extremely low levels while others are overexpressed. As traditional biochemical approaches (such as SDS-PAGE and 2-DE) are capable of detecting/quantifying proteins at a certain quantity, they are generally not sensitive enough for extremely low abundance membrane proteins. Finally, when potent MDR inhibitors, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors, tariquidar, were used to induce apoptosis in tumor cells, severe drug toxicity to normal tissues occurred. All of these factors remain true obstacles; nevertheless, researchers started taking advantages of newly emerging technologies to explore bypasses or alternatives. Besides genetic mutations, MDR in cancer cells could also be induced by epigenetic factors, such as protein expression variations, post-translational modifications, or changes in signaling pathways. Whole exome and bisulfite sequencing help identify novel genetic and epigenetic biomarkers related to the development of drug resistance (Chang et al., 2010; Glasspool et al., 2006; Henrique et al., 2013). Pharmacogenomics combined with genomics and epigenetics, transcriptomics, proteomics as well as metabolic data, are currently used to identify genetic diversities of drug metabolic pathways (Huang and Ratain, 2009; Weng et al., 2013). The unique and novel biomarkers identified through this approach could be used for cancer diagnostics and prediction of pharmacotherapy. Recent studies have found that several signaling pathways are involved in drug resistance, including protein tyrosine kinase (Koch et al., 2015; Rexer et al., 2011; Stebbing et al., 2015), mTOR (Jiang and Liu, 2008; Vo et al., 2014), NF-kB (BentiresAlj et al., 2003; Mongre et al., 2015), EGFR (Porcelli et al., 2014; Song et al., 2015), MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) (Liu et al., 2015a; Wang et al., 2015), and Notch signaling pathways (Cho et al., 2011; Kajiyama et al., 2007; Li et al., 2009). To trace how the ABC superfamily of proteins evolved, Miao’s group performed comparative genomics and phylogenetic analysis based on whole genome sequencing data of different eukaryotic species. The putative evolutionary pathway of ABC transporters showed how gene mutations, duplications, and gene fusions triggered the generation of new functions of ABC transporter proteins (Xiong et al., 2015). In this review article, we summarized the most current studies of ABC drug transporters and their contribution to MDR in cancer. The crystal structures and dynamic nature of ABC proteins during ATP binding, hydrolysis, and drug efflux were discussed in detail. Conserved domains, motifs, and amino acid residues involved in the catalytic function were highlighted. Questions remain on how different drug substrates bind to the drug binding pocket and how they synergistically perform drug efflux function. By integrating experimental data emerging from OMICs technologies into clinical practice, these studies should greatly benefit clinical therapies and drug development toward overcoming cancer MDR	Wen Li a, Han Zhang b, Yehuda G.

24	2016	Bacterial Multidrug Efflux Pumps: Much More Than Antibiotic Resistance Determinants	Abstract: Bacterial multidrug efflux pumps are antibiotic resistance determinants present in all microorganisms. With few exceptions, they are chromosomally encoded and present a conserved organization both at the genetic and at the protein levels. In addition, most, if not all, strains of a given bacterial species present the same chromosomally-encoded efflux pumps. Altogether this indicates that multidrug efflux pumps are ancient elements encoded in bacterial genomes long before the recent use of antibiotics for human and animal therapy. In this regard, it is worth mentioning that efflux pumps can extrude a wide range of substrates that include, besides antibiotics, heavy metals, organic pollutants, plant-produced compounds, quorum sensing signals or bacterial metabolites, among others. In the current review, we present information on the different functions that multidrug efflux pumps may have for the bacterial behaviour in different habitats as well as on their regulation by specific signals. Since, in addition to their function in non-clinical ecosystems, multidrug efflux pumps contribute to intrinsic, acquired, and phenotypic resistance of bacterial pathogens, the review also presents information on the search for inhibitors of multidrug efflux pumps, which are currently under development, in the aim of increasing the susceptibility of bacterial pathogens to antibiotics. 1. Introduction Resistance to antibiotics can be explained in biochemical terms as the inability of a given antibiotic to reach its microbial target at an adequate concentration for inhibiting the target's activity. Within this scope, there are two main ways of acquiring resistance: decreasing the affinity of the target for the antibiotic (mutations in genes encoding the antimicrobial targets) or diminishing the active concentration of the antibiotic inside the cell. For the latter, the mechanisms of resistance can be broadly classified in three categories: (i) production of hydrolytic or modifying enzymes; (ii) mutations in antibiotics' transporters impeding their entrance; and (iii) use of energy-dependent efflux pumps to extrude the antibiotics, impairing their accessibility to the target. Efflux pumps were firstly described as a mechanism of resistance to tetracycline in Escherichia coli [1]. However, nowadays it is well known that efflux pumps constitute the most ubiquitous type of resistance element, present in all organisms from bacteria to mammals, among those that have been described [2,3]. In several cases, the acquisition of resistance to multiple antimicrobials is the consequence of the presence in the same genetic mobile element of several genes, each one encoding a different resistance determinant (co-resistance). However, in some occasions the same determinant can confer resistance to different antimicrobials (cross-resistance). The most conspicuous examples of determinants conferring cross-resistance to different antibiotics are multidrug resistance (MDR) efflux pumps. As stated above, these transporters are present in all organisms, including, in addition to bacterial pathogens [4,5], human cells [6] and eukaryotic pathogens such as Candida albicans [7] or Plasmodium falciparium [8]. It is to be noticed that the efflux systems can actively extrude a variety of compounds; not just conventional antimicrobials, but also non-antibiotic substrates such as dyes, detergents, heavy metals, and organic solvents, among others [9–11]. In the prokaryotic kingdom there are five major families of efflux transporters (Figure 1): the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily [12], the resistance-nodulation-division (RND) family [13], the small multidrug resistance (SMR) family [14], the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) [15], and the multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (MATE) family [16]. These families have been defined on the basis of their sequence similarity, substrate specificity, number of components (single or multiple), number of transmembrane-spanning regions, and energy source. The ABC family utilizes ATP hydrolysis to drive the export of substrates, whereas the other families utilize the proton motive force as the energy source. The MFS, ABC, SMR, and MATE families are widely distributed in Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, while the RND superfamily is specific to Gram-negative microorganisms. The members of the RND family are always forming part of a tripartite complex spanning across the two membranes of Gram-negative bacteria [17]. In Gram-positive bacteria, the MFS family is the most relevant efflux pump group, the best studied members of this family being NorA from Staphylococcus aureus and PmrA from Streptococcus pneumoniae [18–20]. It is important to remark that efflux pumps are ancient, highly-conserved determinants, which have been selected long before the recent use of antibiotics for the therapy of human infections. These characteristics suggest that the role of efflux pumps as relevant antibiotic resistance determinants    Multidrug Efflux Pumps and Antibiotic Resistance The possibility that bacteria can acquire resistance by extruding antibiotics was firstly described in 1980, when McMurry and colleagues described the existence of plasmid-encoded proteins capable of extruding tetracycline and conferring resistance to this antibiotic in E. coli [1]. Although the mechanism was novel, its finding still fitted into the paradigm of acquisition of resistance genes: they confer resistance to one structural family of antibiotics and are acquired through horizontal gene transfer (HGT), likely from antibiotic producers [23,24]. Nevertheless, the finding two years later of a chromosomally-encoded efflux pump, not acquired through HGT and conferring resistance to several drugs [25], challenged this paradigm. Indeed, differing to classical resistance elements, multidrug efflux pumps are present in all organisms and are well conserved among the different members of a given species. Expression of MDR efflux pumps is tightly regulated [26]; some of them are expressed at moderate levels, in which case they contribute to intrinsic resistance, whereas for some others the level of expression is very low, at least under laboratory growing conditions. In both cases, a higher level of expression and hence of antimicrobial resistance can be achieved in two ways (Figure 2); transiently, in the presence of inducers of the efflux pumps' expression (see below), or constitutively, due to mutations in the elements that downregulate their expression [27]. Several studies have highlighted the contribution of MDR efflux pumps to the acquisition of multidrug resistance by different pathogens [5,28–30]. In this regard, it is important to note that while HGT is an important event in spreading resistance, this mechanism requires the presence of a donor of the resistance gene and is less suitable to occur during single-pathogen infections, including chronic infections. For this type of infections, mutation-driven resistance is likely a more frequent mechanism to acquire resistance to antibiotics. Indeed, during antibiotic treatments of infected and/or colonized patients, bacteria may develop resistance to multiple drugs [31]. This observation can be explained either by the in vivo acquisition of genetic mobile elements carrying multiple antibiotic resistance genes [32], or by the selection of resistance mutations conferring a multi-resistance phenotype. Indeed, some recent studies associate the overexpression of MDR efflux pumps with the increasing clinical cases of MDR bacterial infections [33–35]. Although expression of a single efflux pump can confer resistance to multiple antimicrobials, simultaneous overexpression of more than one efflux system has been described in Pseudomonas aeruginosa [36,37] and in Stenotrophomonas maltophilia clinical isolates [38]. Due to their role in antibiotic resistance, efflux pumps can be considered as potentially effective antibacterial targets, and the development of bacterial efflux pump inhibitors may help to improve the therapeutic armamentarium against resistant microorganisms [39–42]. However, efflux pumps differ from other mechanisms of resistance (such as beta-lactamases) that operate over a specific family of antibiotics; any single efflux pump can extrude a wide range of different families of antibiotics, so that its inhibition will increase the bacterial susceptibility to several antimicrobials [43,44]. There exist different possibilities for inhibiting the activity of MDR determinants [27]. One could be the inhibition of the energy sources required for the activity of efflux pumps: the membrane potential and the generation of ATP. However, potential inhibitors of these targets will be toxic as well for human cells and consequently are clinically useless [44]. The search for bacteria-specific elements coupling the energized state of the inner membrane to the activity of efflux pumps as TonB in P. aeruginosa may help in finding valuable targets [45]. Another possibility to inhibit efflux pumps’ activity is by developing compounds able to compete with the antibiotics for their extrusion. One of the first members of this type of inhibitors is the dipeptide amide phenylalanine-arginine-β-naphthylamide (PAβN), which inhibits several [46,47], but not all [48], RND efflux pumps. This synthetic molecule is a competitive inhibitor that binds to the same site used by the efflux pump to bind the antibiotic it extrudes. However, this molecule and its derivatives are too toxic to be used in therapy [39]. Other molecules with efflux pump inhibitory activity are the pyridopyrimidines and arylpiperazines, and there have been efforts to optimize them for therapeutic use [49–51]. Differing from the previously described dipeptide amides, which just the bacterial cell from toxic components of such pollutants. One of the best studied organisms with biodegradative potential is Pseudomonas putida DOT-TE1, a strain able to resist high concentrations of solvents, partly because of the activity of TtgABC, a tripartite RND efflux pump implicated in toluene tolerance in this strain. Expression of TtgABC is down-regulated by the TtgR transcriptional repressor; mutations inactivating TtgR lead to overexpression of the efflux pump, making P. putida DOT-TE1 more resistant than the wild-type strain to chloramphenicol, nalidixic acid, and tetracycline [64]. Further, TtgABC expression is induced by erythromycin, colistin, ceftazidime, and ciprofloxacin, as well by narigenin and toluene [65]. Altogether, these data indicate the multiple roles that this efflux pump may have in different habitats, each one presenting specific inducers of its expression. Another example of efflux pumps involved in biodegradation is NepAB from Arthronobacter nicotinovorans. This efflux pump, which belongs to the SMR family, extrudes methylamine, the last compound resulting from the biodegradation of nicotine [66]. Even in the case of pathogens, efflux pumps can extrude compounds that are not regularly present inside the human host. For instance, it has been shown that the selection of mutants of P. aeruginosa that resist organic solvents leads to overexpression of antibiotic efflux pumps [67]. Taking into account that P. aeruginosa strains exhibit pathogenic and biodegradative properties independently of their origin, it is important to notice that organic solvents and contaminants can co-select resistant strains through overexpression of efflux pumps in non-clinical environments [68], highlighting the potential role that these ecosystems may have in the selection of antibiotic resistance. It is generally assumed that multidrug efflux pumps extrude toxic compounds that are coming from outside the bacteria (antimicrobials produced by competitors, heavy metals, and organic pollutants, among others). However, they can also extrude, and its expression can be induced by, endogenous metabolites. The expression of the efflux pump AcrAB is induced by 2,3-dyhidroxibenzoate, an intermediary metabolite of the synthesis of the siderophore enterobactin [69]. In line with this induction, it has been shown that AcrB, AcrD, and MdtABC are involved in the extrusion of enterobactin [70], and this siderophore is accumulated in a TolC-defective mutant [71]. Similarly, the efflux pump MexGHI is induced by pyocyanine, a secondary metabolite of P. aeruginosa [72] and is involved in the detoxification of anthranilate [73], a precursor of PQS (Pseudomonas Quinolone Signal), a quorum sensing molecule of P. aeruginosa. Another efflux pump of P. aeruginosa, MexEF-OprN, extrudes kynurenine, an intermediate in the pathway of tryptophan degradation and a precursor of anthranilate [74]. Altogether these results point to a role of efflux pumps in the detoxification of damaging endogenous metabolic intermediates. In addition to extruding toxic compounds, different works have shown that efflux pumps can be mediators in cell-to-cell communication processes through the extrusion of signalling molecules. This situation has been studied in more detail in the case of P. aeruginosa, a bacterial species that presents two interlinked quorum sensing systems. In one of them, the signal molecules are homoserine lactones with different acyl chain modifications (AHLs), whereas in the other, the signal is the previously mentioned PQS. It has been reported that MexAB-OprM extrudes 3-oxo-C12-HSL, an AHL signal molecule with a large side acyl chain. Since the quorum sensing response is relevant for P. aeruginosa virulence, resistant mutants overexpressing MexAB, which accumulate lower quantities of this quorum sensing signal, are less virulent [75–77]. Similarly, it has been shown that the deletion of MexGHI reduces the production and secretion of AHLs [73], although a direct role of the efflux pump in the extrusion of these signals has not been demonstrated. As stated above, this efflux pump can extrude anthranilate, a PQS precursor, linking in this way the two quorum sensing regulation pathways of P. aeruginosa [78]. It is to be noted that this effect on PQS secretion is not specific for MexGHI, since it has been demonstrated that MexEF-OprN can extrude kynurenine, another PQS precursor (see above). Altogether, this highlights the great versatility of efflux pumps in extruding a large variety of compounds, a relevant feature for the bacterial adaptation to an assorted range of habitats. o induce the expression of MDR efflux pumps, which on occasion renders a phenotype of transient antibiotic resistance. For instance, it has been shown that pentachlorophenol and triclosan can induce the expression the P. aeruginosa efflux pump mexAB-OprM through their binding to NalC, one of the regulators of the expression of this efflux pump [103]. The exposure to chlorinated phenols and chlorinated phenol-based disinfectants results in the acquisition of a phenotype of transient antibiotic resistance in P. aeruginosa. This increased antibiotic resistance, shown when P. aeruginosa is exposed to chlorinated phenols, might be relevant for the survival of P. aeruginosa in places such as health care units, where combinations of chlorophenols and antibiotics are used [104]. The expression of SmeDEF, the most important MDR efflux pump known to confer antibiotic resistance in S. maltophilia [105], is also induced by biocides. The binding of triclosan, a known substrate of this efflux pump [98] to its transcriptional repressor SmeT [106], causes the overexpression of the SmeDEF efflux pump and reduces S. maltophilia susceptibility to quinolones [107]. Benzalkonium chloride, another common biocide, triggers the expression of smeDEF. However, it does not produce any relevant change in the susceptibility of S. maltophilia to antibiotics. This is likely due to the fact that the concentrations of the b The Functional Role of Multidrug Efflux Pumps in Non-Clinical Environments: Bacteria-Plant Interactions The presence of MDR efflux pumps in bacteria is not restricted to clinical environments, which are characterized by the presence of high levels of antibiotics. Even more, the bacterial species presenting larger numbers of genes encoding efflux pumps are inhabitants of natural environments, such as plants or soil. Nevertheless, there is no correlation between the number of MDR efflux pumps found in each genome and the antibiotic resistance phenotype observed [109,110]. This finding suggests that, besides conferring resistance to antibiotics, efflux pumps may have functions relevant to bacterial behaviour in natural environments. Even in the case of opportunistic pathogens with an environmental origin, the activity of efflux pumps may be relevant for bacterial physiology in natural (non-clinical) ecosystems. For instance, it has been described that the SmeDEF efflux pump, the most important quinolone resistance determinant of S. maltophilia, is involved in bacteria/plant interactions, since a mutant lacking smeE is unable to colonize the roots of the plants [53]. Further supporting the role of efflux pumps in bacteria/plant interactions is the finding that flavonoids can induce SmeDEF expression by binding to its transcriptional repressor SmeT [53]. This feature is not restricted to a given organism—the flavonoid-responsive RND family of efflux pumps includes several members, such as AcrAB from Erwinia amylovora, IfeAB from Agrobacterium tumefaciens, MexAB-OprM from Pseudomonas syringae, BjG30 from Bradyrhizobium japonicum, and EmrAB in Sinorhizobium meliloti [111–115], among others. Further supporting the role of this efflux pump in bacteria/plant interactions, it has been reported that E. amylovora, an enterobacterium that causes fire blight on species of the Rosaceae family, has an AcrAB efflux pump, which confer resistance to phytoalexins, and that is required for successful colonization of the plants and for bacterial virulence [116,117]. This finding is in agreement with the idea that the ability to deal with toxic compounds is one of the key traits for survival in the rhizosphere, and efflux pumps may have a relevant role for achieving resistance to these toxic compounds. To note here that the bacterial response to environmental injuries might be complex, with several elements involved. For instance, E. amylovora, besides AcrAB, presents two other efflux pumps, MdtABC and MdtUVW, which are induced by the polyphenol tannin during their growth in planta. It has been shown that mdtABC- and mdtUVW-deficient mutants have a reduced ability to multiply in apple rootstock, suggesting their implication in resistance to plant antimicrobial compounds   Induction of the Expression of Efflux Pumps Expression of efflux pumps is usually tightly down-regulated, which means that transient high-level expression is achieved just in the presence of the right effectors. Knowing these effectors may be useful to infer the biological roles that these efflux pumps may have, besides resistance to antibiotics. We have already discussed induction of the expression of efflux pumps by plant-produced compounds and by biocides (see above). In addition, it is important to notice that among those effectors that trigger expression of MDR efflux pumps, some might be relevant during infections [26], which links resistance with the virulence of bacterial pathogens [125]. Among them, the RND transporter AcrAB in E. coli has been extensively studied as a prototype of the family, which exports dyes, detergents (including bile salts), chloramphenicol, tetracyclines, macrolides, β-lactams, fluoroquinolones, and organic solvents [126]. Its expression is negatively regulated by AcrR [127], and positively regulated by three XylS/AraC family regulators [128], MarA, SoxS, and Rob (Figure 3). Chemicals commonly found in the intestinal tract, like decanoate or bile salts, are able to induce the expression of acrAB by binding and producing conformational alterations that render the post-translational activation of Rob [128]. Expression of acrAB is also induced during situations in which the cell is under oxidative stress. This induction is SoxRS dependent. Oxidation of the iron–sulfur clusters in SoxR by superoxide species produces the induction of SoxS expression, which binds to the acrAB promoter and induces its expression [129]. The induction of efflux pumps, and consequently antibiotic resistance, in the presence of bile, cationic peptides, or fatty acids [130–132], is clinically relevant because bacteria can encounter these compounds inside the host and therefore might display a phenotype of transient resistance in the course of an infection. Notably, expression of acrAB is triggered through the MarA regulator by salicylate, a phenolic phytohormone implicated in plant growth/development/defence against pathogens, which presents anti-inflammatory properties. Binding of salicylate to MarR, a local repressor of the marRAB operon, causes conformational changes in the protein which leads to disassociation of MarR from the marRAB promoter. As a consequence, expression of marA is de-repressed, which activates expression of acrAB [133]. Phylogenetically close to E. coli, the enterobacterial pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium presents at least nine multidrug efflux pumps. Among these pumps, AcrAB, the ortholog of the E. coli efflux pump with the same name, contributes to antimicrobial resistance and has a wide substrate spectrum that includes antibiotics, dyes, and detergents. AcrAB in Salmonella is induced by indole, bile, and E. coli metabolites [131]. The bile-mediated induction of acrAB expression is dependent on RamA, a regulator belonging to the AraC/XylS family that activates the expression of acrAB and tolC by directly binding their promoter regions. The transcription of ramA is itself repressed by RamR, which is encoded by the gene located immediately upstream of ramA. Both bile and indole trigger ramA transcription [131,134]. It is to be noticed that both bile and indole are present in the gut; bile salts are produced by the host and indole is secreted by many enteric bacterial species, being detected in human faeces. Therefore, RamR may be required by Salmonella to detect environmental cues and for subsequent induction of the AcrAB-TolC system, resulting in bacterial adaptation for Microorganisms 2016, 4, 14 9 of 19 growing in the intestine [135]. In addition to RamA, AcrAB expression is regulated by three activators, MarA, SoxS, Rob, and one repressor, AcrR [127]. This complex regulation may help Salmonella for a fine-tuning response to environmental signals and thus to adapt itself to different environments [135]. For instance, paraquat induces acrAB expression via SoxS, not affecting ramA. SoxS is proposed to bind to the upstream region of acrA and to directly induce acrAB. This suggests that RamA and SoxS competitively bind to the upstream region of acrA.  cefotaxime, novobiocin, ciprofloxacin, and erythromycin. As in the case of Salmonella (see above), the presence of bile salts in the gut may decrease the susceptibility of C. jejuni to antibiotics in vivo. Like in the case of acrAB, salicylate also induces the expression of cmeABC in C. jejuni and promotes the emergence of quinolone-resistant mutants in this bacterial species [140]. This induction can be explained by the fact that salicylate inhibits the binding of CmeR to its operator DNA, although this inhibition is weaker than in the presence of bile salts. Free-living bacteria, including opportunistic pathogens with an environmental origin, should respond to different signals and this may impact their behaviour in clinical and non-clinical ecosystems. For instance, Pseudomonas aeruginosa express several RND-type efflux systems, among which four, MexAB-OprM, MexCD-OprJ, MexEF-OprN, and MexXY-OprM are reported to be significant determinants of multidrug resistance [141]. MexEF-OprN expression is regulated by the transcriptional activator MexT [142]. Expression of this efflux pump is induced, via MexT, by nitrosative stress as well as by chloramphenicol, a nitrosated aromatic compound that probably mimics a nitrosated product of nitrosative stress [143]. Airway epithelial cells are known to produce NO upon stimulation by bacteria and it has been shown that mexEF-oprN is overexpressed when P. aeruginosa grows on human epithelial cells [144]. A distinctive feature of the P. aeruginosa MexXY-OprM system is that the expression of mexXY is induced by exposure to several of the antibiotics that target the ribosome and that this efflux system exports [145]. However, these antimicrobials do not interact with MexZ, the mexXY repressor [146]; expression of the efflux pump being induced just when the ribosome is functionally impaired [147]. The fact that the expression of MDR efflux pumps is induced by host-produced compounds suggests that they can play a role in the virulence of bacterial pathogens, a possibility that was discussed a decade ago [148]. Indeed, it has been shown that the Vibrio cholerae efflux pump VexB is the primary efflux system responsible for resistance to bile salts in this microorganism [149]. Since bile salts are present at the human gut, the activity of this efflux pump is a pre-requisite for V. cholerae infection. A similar situation happens with AcrAB, the main pump responsible for bile salts resistance in Enterobacteriaceae [150], which is required for the pathogenesis of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium [151]. Notably this efflux pump is involved as well in the bacterial capability for forming biofilms [152,153]. A protective role to host antibacterial compounds has also been described in the case of Neisseria gonorrhoeae. In this organism, the MtrCDE efflux pump contributes to resistance to vertebrate antibacterial peptides [132,154], and FarAB is involved in resistance to long-chain fatty acids [155]. The activity of these efflux pumps contributes to the pathogenesis of N. gonorrhoeae [154,156]. Similarly, the Campylobacter jejuni CmeABC efflux pump confers resistance to bile salts, fatty acids, and detergents, and is needed for the colonization of the intestinal tract [157]. In addition to their protective role against host antibacterial compounds, efflux pumps may be involved in other aspects of bacterial virulence. The contribution of the MDR efflux pumps MexAB-OprM, MexCD-OprJ, MexEF-OprM, and MexXY to P. aeruginosa virulence has been studied by using knock-out mutants of each of them [158]. With the exception of mexCD-OprJ, all knock-out mutants were impaired in their capability of invading MDCK cells, the effect being higher in the case of the mexAB-OprM mutant, this efflux pump being essential for inducing lethal septicaemia in a murine model. Together with their role in modulating the quorum-sensing response, and consequently bacterial virulence [74,75,77,159,160], these results support the notion that MDR efflux pumps, besides contributing to the resistance of bacterial pathogens, are major contributors to their pathogenicity [148]. Inhibition of efflux pumps may then allow to both increase the susceptibility to antibiotics and reduce the virulence of bacterial pathogens. As discussed above, expression of efflux pumps can be triggered by a variety of effectors, and even physiological situations as it happens in the case of n  Conclusions Multidrug efflux pumps are ancient elements encoded in the chromosomes of microorganisms. They can confer resistance to antibiotics at different levels: intrinsic resistance, acquired resistance, and transient induced phenotypic resistance. In addition, multidrug efflux pumps display different functions with relevance to bacterial adaptation to different habitats. Some of these functions, such as resistance to heavy metals, biocides, or solvents, resemble antibiotic resistance, since they are adaptive responses to different types of external injuries, whereas others are related to internal detoxification of intermediate toxic bacterial metabolites. In addition, some efflux pumps are involved in antimicrobial or even interkingdom signalling. Among the latter, it is important to mention that different efflux pumps are involved in bacterial virulence, in both plant and animal hosts. Altogether, currently available information supports the notion that, besides contributing to antibiotic resistance, multidrug efflux pumps display a variety of functions with relevance to bacterial behaviour in different ecosystems.	Paula Blanco, Sara Hernando-Amado, Jose Antonio Reales-Calderon, Fernando Corona, Felipe Lira, Manuel Alcalde-Rico, Alejandra Bernardini, Maria Blanca Sanchez and Jose Luis Martinez
25	2018	Redox-triggered mitoxantrone prodrug micelles for overcoming multidrug-resistant breast cancer	Abstract Multidrug resistance (MDR) severely hinders the efficient chemotherapeutic treatments of cancer. D-α-Tocopherol polyethylene 1000 succinate (TPGS) based drug delivery system holds the potential of re-sensitizing resistant cancer cells. In this study, a TPGS prodrug containing both TPGS and mitoxantrone (MTO) via a disulfide bond was synthesized and assembled into micelle (TSMm) with a monodispersed diameter of 46.50 ± 1.12 nm. The disulfide bonds within the micelles could be cleaved in response to a high concentration of intracellular glutathione (GSH) after entering the tumor cells, leading a rapid release of MTO. In vitro cytotoxicity study showed TSMm significantly inhibited the growth of resistant breast tumor cells MDA-MB-231/MDR comparing to either free MTO or disulfide-free prodrug micelle (TCMm). In addition, TSMm could sustain favorable intracellular retention and cause the depletion of ATP activity, leading to the preferential transportation of MTO into the nucleus and the reversal of MDR. In vivo imaging also verified that TSMm was specifically targeted to the tumor regions at 24 h post injection. Finally, TSMm has significantly stronger antitumor activity in xenograft nude mice with negligible side effects. Hence, TSMm can serve as promising prodrug candidates to strengthen the reversal of MDR in tumors with less side effects.  major obstacle (Yan et al., 2010). Multiple biochemical mechanisms are involved in the occurrence of MDR. The most prevalent mechanism is associated with the overexpression of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter, particularly P-glycoprotein (P-gp) (Aller et al., 2009). In tumor environment, P-gp recognizes a large number of structurally diversified antineoplastic agents (e.g., anthracyclines, taxanes) as substrates through its large binding pocket for an ATP-dependent efflux, consequently decreasing the intracellular concentration of active drugs. Thus, inhibition of P-gp is expected to re-sensitize MDR cells, and a variety of P-gp inhibitors have been intensively examined in both preclinical and clinical studies (Szakacs et al., 2004). Unfortunately, most of the trials have only shown limited success to date, mainly due to the lack of specificity and efficacy (Fletcher et al., 2010). These limitations have spurred efforts in the search for new compounds with improved potency to battle against MDR cancers. D-α-Tocopherol polyethylene 1000 succinate  employed TPGS as the drug resensitizing agent to reverse the multi-drug resistance of cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drugs (Mu and Seow, 2006). Mitoxantrone (MTO), a synthetic anthracenedione derivative, is a well-established anticancer agent used in clinic with high therapeutic efficacy in breast cancer, prostate cancers, lymphoma, and leukemia (Shen et al., 2009). However, MTO still suffers from severe multi-drug resistance in tumor cells possibly because it can serve as a substrate of efflux transporter (Diah et al., 2001). Thus, a series of delivery strategies have been designed and developed to help MTO reverse MDR. Although some interesting and unique advantages are found in these formulations, they still have inherent questions that need to be addressed (Chang et al., 2010, Toh et al., 2014). Moreover, most delivery systems employed physical encapsulation strategy to trap MTO within nanodevice, while few researches on covalent linked MTO conjugates are reported. The covalent conjugate strategy is generally considered to offer stronger stability during in vivo circulation compared with physical encapsulation (Cao and Feng, 2008). Although some uncleavable polymer-drug conjugates such as PGA-PTX and TPGS-CPT have also been reported, it still remains obscure how to selectively and efficiently deliver chemotherapeutic drugs to cancer cells and reverse MDR (Bao et al., 2014). A redox-triggered MTO prodrug containing TPGS and disulfide linkage was developed and investigated in this study. The designing idea was to inhibit P-gp activity with TPGS while gaining a sensitive drug release manner which responds to the tumor microenvironment. Amphiphilic TPGS-based MTO prodrug could self-assemble into micelles (TSMm) through hydrophobic interaction and remain stable in blood plasma. The disulfide bonds in micelles could be cleaved at high concentration of intracellular glutathione (GSH) upon when the prodrug enters the JUST ACCEPTED cytoplasm of tumor cells, leading to a rapid release of the active MTO and consequently achieving the improved therapeutic effect. Simultaneously, the disassociated TPGS segment could bind and restrain the activity of P-gp, which in return could help preventing the efflux of MTO and reverse MDR of cancer cells (Fig. 1). In vitro cytotoxicity, cellular retention and intracellular trafficking were studied in the MDA-MB-231/MDR cells, and the mechanisms of overcoming MDR were explored. The biodistribution, tumor inhibition effect, and safety profile of the prodrug were also evaluated on tumor-bearing mice. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Materials D-α-Tocopherol polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (TPGS) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. LLC. (Shanghai, China). 1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC), N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS), 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP), 3,3’-dithiodipropionic acid (DTDP), succinic anhydride (SA) and triethylamine (TEA) were purchased from Aladdin-Reagent Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Mitoxantrone dihydrochloride (MTO) was obtained from Hubei Jianyuan Chemical Co., Ltd. (Hubei, China). DAPI were purchased from KeyGEN BioTECH (Nanjing, China). 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and BCA Protein Assay Kit were purchased from Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology Co. LLC. (Nantong, China). All reactant water used in the laboratory was obtained from a Milli-Q ® Plus System (Billerica, MA, USA). All the chemicals and reagents were HPLC or analytical grade. JUST ACCEPTED 2.2. Cell culture Wild-type MDA-MB-231 (MDA-MB-231) human breast cancer cells and the mitoxantrone resistant MDA-MB-231 cells overexpressing P-glycoprotein (P-gp) (MDA-MB-231/MDR) were obtained from KeyGEN BioTECH (Nanjing, China). Cells were cultured in L-15 (Gibco® , USA) with 10% (v/v) FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (100 IU/mL) in an incubator (Corning, USA) at 37 °C under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 90% relative humidity. The cells were subcultured every 3 days at 80% confluence using 0.25% (w/v) trypsin at a split ratio of 1:5. 2.3. Animals Female BALB/c nude mice (5-6 weeks old) were obtained from the Shanghai Silaike Laboratory Animal Ltd. (Shanghai, China) and housed on standard laboratory diet at an ambient temperature and humidity in air-conditioned chambers. All animal study protocols were designed in accordance with guidelines set by the National Institute of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and approved by the Animal Ethical Experimentation Committee of Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine. 2.4. Synthesis of TPGS conjugated MTO prodrug Redox-sensitive TPGS conjugated MTO prodrug (TSM) was synthesized via a two-step conjugation as previously described with slight modification (Bao et al., 2014). Briefly, dithiodipropionicanhydride (DTDPA) was first synthesized through a dehydration reaction. Then TPGS (1.0 g, 0.65 mmol), DTDPA (0.21 g, 0.98 mmol), and DMAP (0.08 g, 0.65 mmol) were dissolved in DMF with 0.2 mL of TEA and reacted at room temperature under nitrogen environment for 24 h. The products were JUST ACCEPTED purified using dialysis bags (1 kDa MW cutoff, Greenbird Co., China) against ethanol overnight and evaporated by vacuum distillation to remove ethanol. The obtained carboxylic TPGS (1.0 g, 0.61 mmol) was pre-activated with EDC (0.35 g, 1.83 mmol) and NHS (0.21 g, 1.83 mmol) in DMSO for 2 h before the addition of MTO (0.5 g, 0.97 mmol) solution in DMSO with 1 ml of TEA. Another 24 h were allowed for the completion of the reaction under nitrogen atmosphere. The resultant mixture was filtered and dialyzed against deionized water for 48 h before lyophilization. Non-redox-sensitive MTO prodrug (TCM) was prepared in a similar manner except SA was used to replace DTDPA. Both products were characterized by 1H NMR and FT-IR, respectively. 2.5. Preparation and characterization of MTO prodrug micelles TPGS-MTO (both TSM and TCM) prodrug micelles were prepared by a film-dispersion method. Briefly, 100 mg of MTO prodrug was dissolved in 20 mL ethanol and a rotary evaporator was employed to remove the solvent under vacuum at 40 °C. The obtained dry film was suspended in 10 mL water and MTO prodrug micelles (TSMm and TCMm) were formed subsequently. Blank TPGS micelles were prepared by the same method in the absence of MTO. Particle size, polydispersity index (PDI) and zeta potential of MTO prodrug micelles were determined using a dynamic light scattering (DLS) (Nano-ZS90, Malvern Instruments Ltd., UK) at 25 °C with a scattering angle 90°. The amount of MTO in prodrug micelles was measured at wavelength 658 nm by a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu Co., Japan) according to a predetermined standard curve of MTO. The MTO loading content (DLC %) was defined as the percentage of the drug to the total weight of prodrug micelles. Surface tension was measured on a JUST ACCEPTED Dataphysics DCAT-21 tensionmeter (San Jose, CA, USA). Briefly, the sample was dissolved in distilled water and diluted successively to concentration (0.1–104 mg/L) at ambient temperature. Critical micellar concentration (CMC) value was taken from the intersection of the tangent to the curve at the inflection with the horizontal tangent through the points at low concentrations (Qiao et al., 2014). The morphological observation was performed under TEM (H-7650, Hitachi, Japan) following negative staining with 1 wt % sodium phosphotungstate solution. 2.6. In vitro release and stability of MTO prodrug micelles TEM was used to measure the disassembly process of redox-sensitive MTO prodrug micelles induced by GSH. Lyophilized TSMm powder containing 1 mg MTO was dissolved and incubated in 5 mL PBS (pH 7.4) with 10 mM GSH for 4 h before staining by sodium phosphotungstate for the measurement. The release of MTO from prodrug micelles was evaluated using the dialysis method (Sun et al., 2016). 2 mL prodrug micelles containing 1 mg of MTO was placed in a dialysis bag (1 kDa MW cutoff) and incubated in 50 mL release medium PBS (pH 7.4) solutions with different concentrations of GSH (10 μM, 1 mM or 10 mM) at 37 °C. 5 mL of sample was collected at specific time intervals and the equal amount of fresh medium was refilled afterwards to keep testing condition identical. The concentration of released MTO in the testing medium was determined by UV-Vis spectrophotometer. The MTO release from TCMm in PBS containing 10 mM GSH was also measured as control. For stability assay, TSMm or TCMm was suspended in 10 mM PBS with 140 mM NaCl (pH 7.4) and fresh rat plasma. The incubation temperature was kept at 37 °C. 5 mL solution was collected at predetermined time points for measurement of JUST ACCEPTED size and distribution by DLS (Qiao et al., 2014). 2.7. In vitro cytotoxicity MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-231/MDR cells were seeded in 6-well plates with 1×106 cells/well and cultured at 37 °C for 24 h. Cells were collected and lysed in ice-cold RIPA buffer containing 1 mM PMSF. P-gp expression was determined by western blot assay as described previously (Shi et al., 2015). The cytotoxicity of MTO, TCMm and TSMm against MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-231/MDR cells was assessed with the MTT assay (Qiao et al., 2013). The cells were seeded into a 96-well plate at a density of 1×104 cells/well and exposed to MTO, TCMm and TSMm at different concentrations of MTO (10-3 ~20 μg/mL) for 24 h. 20 µL of MTT solution (5 mg/mL) was added into each well. The cells were stained for 4 h before the removal of the medium, and redissolved in 150 µL of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The absorbance intensity was checked at testing wavelength of 570 nm with a reference measurement at 630 nm by a microplate reader (Varioskan™ LUX, Thermo Scientific). In order to further investigate the growth inhibition of tumor in presence of prodrug micelle, three-dimensional multicellular tumor spheroids of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-231/MDR cells were produced (Wang et al, 2013). When the mean diameter of tumor spheroids was around 200-250 μm, MTO, TCMm and TSMm of (20 μg/mL MTO) were added respectively and co-cultured for 24 h. The morphology of tumor spheroids was observed under the microscope. The average diameter of tumor spheroids was calculated by randomly measuring 6 tumor spheroids in different regions. JUST ACCEPTED 2.8. In vitro MTO retention profile. To visualize in vitro drug retention, MDA-MB-231/MDR cells (1×104 cells/well) were seeded in 6-well plates and cultured for 24 h at 37 °C. Then cells were treated with free MTO, TCMm or TSMm at the MTO concentration of 5 μg/mL for 4 h. After that, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and incubated in complete growth media for 6 and 12 h, respectively. Cells were then washed and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 10 min at 37 °C. After stained with DAPI for 10 min, cells were observed using a confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM, Zeiss LSM 510, Germany). The nucleus was visualized with the DAPI channel at an excitation/emission wavelength of 345/455 nm, and intracellular MTO was visualized with the Cy5 channel at an excitation/emission wavelength of 610/685 nm according to literature (Bao et al., 2014). The intracellular fluorescence intensity was calculated using Image Pro-plus software and then normalized on the basis of the original fluorescence intensity: Drug retention efficiency (%) = intracellular fluorescence intensity/original intracellular fluorescence intensity. 2.9. Effect of MTO prodrug micelles on P-gp expression and intracellular ATP level To determine the effects of TPGS on the P-gp expression in MDA-MB-231/MDR cells, cells were seeded in six-well plates (1 × 105 cells/well) and incubated with free MTO, TCMm and TSMm with the MTO concentration of 5 μg/mL for 4 h. Cells incubated with serum-free culture medium were taken as control. Then cells were collected with trypsin, immobilized with 4% paraformaldehyde, and subsequently incubated with 30 μL P-gp antibody or with the isotype control antibody at 4 °C for 90 min. After that, cells were suspended in PBS and analyzed by flow cytometry (Wang et al., 2015). JUST ACCEPTED To measure the intracellular ATP content, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-231/MDR cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well and treated with free MTO, TCMm or TSMm with the MTO concentration of 5 μg/mL for 4 h. The equivalent content of TCM and TSM were used as control. The kit was based on the luciferin/luciferase assay (Beyotime, China) and utilized to determine the ATP level in cell lysate. The luminescence was measured by the multifunctional microplate reader. ATP concentrations were calculated by an ATP standard calibration curve and normalized by protein content in each sample determined by a BCA kit (Beyotime, China) 2.10. Intracellular trafficking MDA-MB-231/MDR cells (1×105 cells/well) were seeded in a confocal microscopy dish. After incubated with TCMm or TSMm (5 μg/ml MTO concentration) at 37 °C for 4 h, cells were washed by ice-cold PBS twice, followed by incubation with fresh culture medium for additional 12 h. Then cells were stained by LysoTrackerTM Green (50 nM) for 20 min and DAPI (20 μM) for 10 min at 37 °C. Subsequently, cells were rinsed by ice-cold PBS twice and immediately observed with CLSM. 2.11. In vivo imaging study To determine in vivo biodistribution of micelles, near-infrared dye Cy7 (Beijing Fanbo, China) was loaded into TCMm and TSMm at the similar drug-loading content (~0.5%) according to the protocol above. The tumor xenograft model was established by subcutaneously inoculating MDA-MB-231/MDR cells (1×107 cells/mouse) into the axillary region of female nude mice. The tumor size was monitored with a fine caliper and the tumor volume (V) was calculated by formula V = L × W2 /2, where L and W JUST ACCEPTED were the length and width of the tumor, respectively. Once the tumors grew to a certain size (100 mm3 ), Cy7-loaded MTO prodrug micelles were dosed intravenously into the mice at Cy7 concentration of 50 nmol/kg. Images were taken at 24 h post-injection on Kodak FX PRO system (Rochester, NY, USA) at excitation wavelength of 720 nm and emission of 790 nm. The tumor as well as major organs were collected from the mice after euthanasia and subjected to ex vivo imaging. Images were inspected using the Kodak Molecular Imaging Software 5X. 2.12. In vivo antitumor efficacy and safety profiles MDA-MB-231/MDR tumor xenograft model was first constructed in female nude mice. When the tumor volume reached to 50 mm3 , the mice were weighed and randomly divided into 4 groups (n=6) before intravenously administrattion with saline, MTO, TCMm or TSMm at the total drug dose of 5 mg/kg every other day for two weeks. The tumor size and body weight of the mice were recorded at the predetermined time spots. The tumor inhibitory rate (TIR) was calculated using the following formula: TIR (%) = (WC − WT) / WC × 100%, where WC and WT represent the mean tumor weight of the control group and the treated groups, respectively. On Day 14, the tumors were harvested from the mice right after euthanasia, washed twice with saline, and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for TUNEL apoptosis staining following the manufacturer’s instruction. DAPI was used for nuclear counterstaining. The stained tumor slides were examined by fluorescence microscope (IX51, Olympus). Healthy BALB/c nude mice were used to assess in vivo adverse effect of MTO micelles by intravenously administrating TSMm or TCMm at MTO concentration of 5 mg/kg every other day for two weeks. Free MTO solution and saline were also JUST ACCEPTED applied as positive and negative control, respectively. One day after the last dose, the animals were sacrificed to collect and process the hearts and kidneys for histological H&E analysis. Three different sections were analyzed in each organ specimen. 2.13. Statistical analysis Significant differences were determined using the Student's t-test where differences were considered significant (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001). All data are expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Synthesis of TPGS conjugated MTO prodrug TPGS conjugated MTO prodrug (TCM or TSM) was synthesized via a two-step esterification reaction using either SA or DTDPA as a linker, respectively (Supplementary Data, Fig. S1). Representative structural validation of MTO prodrug was completed by 1H NMR and FT-IR (Supplementary Data, Fig. S2 and S3). 1H NMR spectrum of the MTO prodrug displayed all the expected proton peaks of TPGS and MTO such as 0.84 ppm (-CH3), 4.14 ppm (-CH2-CH2-O- of TPGS) and aromatic hydrogen at 7.19-7.65 ppm of MTO, indicating the completion of conjugation between carboxylic TPGS and MTO. These information were also consistent with other reports (Bao et al., 2014), further proving the successful synthesis of TCM and TSM conjugates. 3.2. Preparation and characterization of MTO prodrug micelles MTO prodrug micelles (TCMm and TSMm) were prepared via the film-dispersion method. Table 1 gave a summary of characteristic parameters of the prepared prodrug JUST ACCEPTED micelles. TCMm and TSMm displayed similar size distribution of approximate 46 nm determined by DLS, which was larger than blank TPGS micelles (18.54 ± 1.17 nm). Previous reported showed that the mean diameter of TPGS-conjugated paclitaxel micelle was around 140 nm (Bao et al., 2014). The size variation was probably associated with the difference of molecule size and oil-water partition coefficients. The MTO loading content was determined to be 20.61 ± 0.24% for TCMm and 19.73 ± 0.52% for TSMm, close enough to the theoretical calculation from the molecular structure (21.75% and 20.82%), further proving that both TCM and TSM conjugates were obtained with satisfactory purity. There was no significant difference between the zeta potential values of blank TPGS and prodrug micelles. Negatively charged the surface of micelles can evade non-specific distribution, resulting in prolonged in vivo circulation and decreased toxicity (Sheng et al., 2016). CMC results showed prodrug micelle possessed lower value than that of TPGS, which was attributed to the changed hydrophilic/lipophilic balance value. Low CMC would be beneficial for micelles to resist dilution in the blood circulation (Qiao et al., 2013). Fig. 2A showed TCMm and TSMm were well dispersed in spherical shape with an average particle size around 35 nm, slightly smaller than the value determined by DLS. 3.3. In vitro release and stability of MTO prodrug micelles To investigate the destabilization of redox-sensitive prodrug micelles, the morphology of TSMm was checked by TEM in the presence of 10 mM GSH, a concentration similar to the intracellular GSH level (Li et al., 2012). In contrast to TSMm in physiological environment which self-assemble into spheres, micelles in high GSH-containing environment were found to aggregate into particles with irregular-shape and larger-size (Fig. 2A). Indeed, after filtration against 0.22 μm JUST ACCEPTED microporous membrane, the filtrate of TSMm showed significantly reduced derived count rate under DLS (data not presented), implying the decrease of micelle concentration after the treatment of 10 mM GSH. Subsequently, in vitro release of MTO prodrug micelles was evaluated under different GSH condition, i.e., 10 μM, 1 mM, and 10 mM, which were used to simulate plasma and the reductive intracellular milieu (1–10 mM GSH), respectively (Li et al., 2012). As shown in Fig. 2B, inefficient and slow release of MTO from TSMm was observed in the presence of 10 μM GSH. Only less than 10% MTO was released during the first 4 h and approximately 12.4% released within 24 h. However, increasing of GSH concentration from 10 μM to 1 mM dramatically accelerated the release of MTO. Approximately 15.7% of MTO was freed from conjugates in 4 h and near 30.0% in 24 h. An even higher GSH concentration of 10 mM lead to about 38.5% of MTO released in 4 h and total 70.0% within 24 h. In stark contrast, the release of MTO from TCMm was obviously inefficient even incubating with 10 mM GSH, and was only comparable to that of TSMm in the presence of 10 μM GSH. Given the results from TEM study, it was confirmed that TSMm was very likely to decompose and release active MTO subsequently in a highly reducing environment. These phenomena strongly supported our designing idea of using GSH concentration gradient to realize the redox-activated release of MTO from TSMm for the intracellular delivery of anticancer drug. Fig. 2C showed the results regarding the stability of TCMm and TSMm in 10 mM PBS with140 mM NaCl (pH 7.4) and fresh rat plasma, respectively. During the whole incubation process at 37 °C, mean diameter only experienced minor fluctuations around 2 nm of the original size, demonstrating the satisfactory stability of prodrug micelles under normal physiological condition. JUST ACCEPTED 3.4. In vitro cytotoxicity Overexpression of P-gp on the membrane of MDA-MB-231/MDR cells was concluded as one of the leading causes of the MDR phenotype (Hao et al., 2015). Firstly, we used western blot assay to verify the P-gp expression level of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-231/MDR cells. As shown in Fig. 3A, P-gp expression was significantly higher by 10-fold in MDA-MB-231/MDR cells compared to the MDA-MB-231 cells. The cytotoxicity of MTO prodrug micelles against both MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-231/MDR cells was performed with MTT assay. As shown in Fig. 3B, all formulations had cytotoxicity against MDA-MB-231 cells depending on different drug concentration. While the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of TCMm was significantly higher than that of free MTO (248 μg/mL vs. 0.45 μg/mL), TSMm were found much more effective than TCMm with a low IC50 value of 1.86 μg/mL. The unsatisfactory toxicity of TCMm could mainly come from the non-sensitive degradability of covalent linkage and minor release of active MTO. The time-consuming intracellular transport pathway might account for the relatively lower cytotoxicity of TSMm comparing to free MTO (Jiang et al., 2015). However, the results were quite different on (Fig. 3C). A noticeable decrease of cytotoxicity was observed for free MTO. The cell killing ability of free MTO on MDA-MB-231/MDR cells was only comparable to TCMm (p>0.05), while TSMm was most efficient in inhibiting the proliferation of MDA-MB-231/MDR cells. The similar phenomenon was also observed in three-dimensional tumor spheroids of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-231/MDR cells (Fig. 3D and 3E). The cell cytotoxicity was usually  3.5. In vitro MTO retention profile. To confirm the hypothesis that prominent cytotoxicity of TSMm against MDA-MB-231/MDR was associated with increased intracellular concentration of MTO, in vitro MTO retention assay was performed at 6 and 12 h after 4 h of treatment with MTO, TCMm or TSMm, respectively (Fig. 4A and 4B). At 6 h, all testing formulations had visible retention in the cells, with TSMm exhibiting higher drug retention efficiency of 49.1 ± 2.0% compared to either TCMm or MTO with retention of 36.7 ± 3.5% and 22.3 ± 3.1% respectively. However, at 12 h, cells treated with TSMm showed remarkably higher retention than MTO. The retention efficiency of TSMm, TCMm and MTO after 12 h was 57.2 ± 1.7%, 32.3 ± 4.9% and 4.3 ± 1.5%, respectively. Indeed, further study indicated TSMm scarcely increased the cellular uptake of MTO comparing to TCMm (P>0.05) (data not listed), hence the floating   Effect of MTO prodrug micelles on P-gp expression and intracellular ATP level As mentioned above, TPGS conjugated MTO prodrug micelles can effectively inhibit the efflux pump and prolong the intracellular retention of MTO. To investigate the mechanism in details, the influence of prodrug micelles on P-gp expression was inspected using flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 4C, neither free MTO nor MTO prodrug micelles had a significant influence on the P-gp expression of MDA-MB-231/MDR cells (p>0.05). Therefore, instead of reducing the expression of P-gp, the suppression of the function of P-gp was probably the reason why MTO prodrug micelles exerted the antagonizing drug-resistance effect (Hao et al., 2015). Furthermore, the intracellular ATP concentration was quantified after treating cells with different formulations for 4h. A notable decrease of the intracellular ATP level occurred in MDA-MB-231 cells for all treating groups (Fig. 4D). However, there is no significant difference in the ATP level of the MTO treating MDA-MB-231/MDR cells compared with control group (p>0.05). In contrast, TCMm, TSMm, TCM and TSM all resulted in a significant decrease in the intracellular ATP level comparing to the control group (p<0.01), respectively. The cellular ATP JUST ACCEPTED depletion induced by MTO prodrug micelles could be ascribed to the specific interaction of TPGS with mitochondrial organelles (Oliveira et al., 2016). According to previous reports, Vitamin E and its analogs were able to interact and hinder the ubiquinone-binding sites of mitochondrial complex II in the respiratory chain (Danhier et al., 2014), causing the destabilization of mitochondrial membranes and destruction of the energy supply of mitochondria (Wang et al., 2015). Researchers have also revealed the importance of intracellular ATP level in maintaining the chemoresistance of cancer cells. It is postulated that extra amount of ATP (“ATP debt”) is demanded to ensure the survival homeostatic pathways, which makes the depletion of intracellular ATP a rational mechanism of resensitizing cross-resistant cells to multiple chemotherapeutic drugs (Zhou et al., 2012). The improved results demonstrated above, including cytotoxicity and cellular retention, were all roughly identical to decreased intracellular ATP concentration. As a consequence, it is speculated that TSMm could deplete cellular ATP to partially reverse the drug-resistant phenotype and re-sensitize the resistant cell lines to MTO treatment. 3.7. Intracellular trafficking Confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) was employed to further investigate the intracellular delivery pathway of MTO prodrug micelles (TCMm and TSMm) in MDA-MB-231/MDR cells. As shown in Fig. 4E, the endocytosed MTO prodrug micelles were found to partially localize in the endo-lysosomes by the observation of overlaid yellow fluorescence from MTO and LysoTracker after 12 h of incubation. Moreover, the apparent separation of red fluorescence indicated that the effective escape of MTO from the endo-lysosomes was possibly from the interference of TPGS with biomembrane. However, it was noteworthy that few red fluorescent MTO was JUST ACCEPTED overlapped with nuclei for TCMm. In contrast, the nuclei of cells treated with TSMm tended to contain more MTO as evidenced by the larger merged magenta fluorescence from the blue nucleus and red MTO. The preferable accumulation of MTO in nuclei was considered to play a major role in the activation of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway (Toh et al., 2014). These phenomena demonstrated that high level of GSH in the cytoplasm could activate TSMm to release MTO and facilitate the penetration of MTO into the nucleus, which may account for the increased sensitivity of resistant breast cancer cells to MTO. Conversely, it would be difficult for undissociated TCMm to reach the nucleus due to the clearance within the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and intracellular regulatory mechanism in cancer cells (Liu et al., 2012a). 3.8. In vivo imaging study To gain knowledge of the targetability of MTO prodrug micelles in vivo, the biodistribution of Cy7-loaded TCMm and TSMm was monitored using a non-invasive near-infrared optical imaging technique after intravenous administration into the MB-MDA-231/MDR tumor-implanted nude mice. As shown in Fig. 5A, most of the Cy7 signal was detected in liver and tumor at 24 h post administration. TPGS mediated increase of phagocytosis by macrophages could explain the higher liver distribution (Bao et al., 2014), while high tumor accumulation of MTO prodrug micelles was mainly attributed to the enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR effect) (Liu et al., 2012b). Of note, preferential accumulation of fluorescence in the tumor tissues was more evident for TSMm than TCMm. The quantitative region-of-interest (ROI) analysis of excised tumors proved a 2-fold higher fluorescent intensity at the tumor tissue for sensitive TSMm compared with insensitive TCMm (Fig. 5B). We reasoned that the difference could come from the reduction triggered JUST ACCEPTED intracellular disaggregation of TSMm, which may attenuate the shielding effect of hydrophilic corona and decrease the self-quenching of fluorescent dye in micelles (Li et al., 2012). Moreover, almost negligible fluorescence was shown in other organs, indicating the possible reduction of the cardiotoxicity and nephrotoxicity, both of which are generally considered as major unwanted side-effects of MTO in clinic (Paul et al., 2007). Overall, these results implied that redox-sensitive TSMm could be expected to be a potential tumor suppressing candidate for enhanced therapeutic efficacy and reduced side effects. 3.9 In vivo antitumor efficacy and safety profiles In vivo antitumor study of TSMm was conducted on MDA-MB-231/MDR tumor xenograft models to prove the feasibility of MTO prodrug micelles for the reversal of multidrug resistance in animals. As shown in Fig. 6A, the tumor growth was suppressed after the successive intravenous injection of various MTO formulations including the MTO solution, TCMm, and TSMm, compared with negative control saline. It is worth noting that TSMm showed a dominant effect on tumor inhibition than the free MTO solution (p <0.05), further validating the combinatory advantage of reversing multidrug resistance by TPGS conjugation and disulfide bond mediated reduction-triggered MTO release. Unexpectedly, TCMm performed slightly better on tumor growth inhibition than the MTO solution (p >0.05), which was inconsistent with the in vitro data. We postulated that the EPR effect of nanoscaled micelles might lead to an increased accumulation of free MTO in tumor region during the treatment and slow down the tumor progression. As shown in Fig. 6B, the body weight of mice receiving either TSMm or TCMm remained stable, while the loss of weight was observed for mice receiving MTO solution during the treatment. Extensive JUST ACCEPTED fluorescence from cell apoptosis was observed by in situ TUNEL assay after the treatment of either TCMm or TSMm, showing a massive cancer cell remission (Fig. 6C). Tumor tissues collected from the mice receiving TSMm had the highest level of cell apoptosis ratio compared with MTO and TCMm (approximately 65% tumor apoptosis or necrosis vs. 10.4% and 35.7% respectively), indicating that the prominent capability of tumor growth inhibition was partly due to the elevated apoptosis activated by TSMm. Finally, the potential adverse effects of the TPGS prodrug micelles during the treatment cycle was evaluated by dosing the healthy mice with the same treatment regimens. Organs such as heart, liver, spleen, lung and kidney were gathered for histopathological evaluation. No obvious pathological abnormalities, degenerations or lesions were detected in mice treated with TCMm, TSMm and saline. Symptoms of clinical toxicity were recorded after different treatments and the organs were examined by H&E (Fig. 6D). Compared with saline group, no noticeable dehydration, locomotor disability, muscle loss, anorexia or other toxicity symptoms were observed during the treatment period of TSMm or TCMm. Also, no behavioral abnormalities were found in the treating mice. On the other hand, some deformations were seen in the architecture of major organs, i.e., disordered arrangement even rupture of myocardial fiber, tubular dilation accompanied with glomerular atrophy in kidney, indicating the cardiotoxicity and nephrotoxicity from MTO. 4. Conclusions In summary, an amphiphilic TPGS-based MTO prodrug was developed by conjugating MTO to TPGS via a disulfide bond. The resulted prodrug was able to self-assemble into micelles (TSMm) with modest size and surface properties. The JUST ACCEPTED designed prodrug micelles rendered excellent stability in the physical conditions and could release MTO via thiolysis at the high concentration of GSH within the tumorous cytoplasm, giving rise to higher cytotoxicity and apoptosis-promoting activity. Moreover, we demonstrated that TSMm could remarkably increase the intracellular concentration and retention of MTO by redox-triggered release and the reduction of the drug efflux rate. Depletion of cellular ATP by TSMm treatment probably accounts for the reversal of drug-resistant phenotype and re-sensitization of the resistant cell lines to MTO. Importantly, TSMm showed high tumor accumulation and excellent antitumor effect in the MDA-MB-231/MDR xenograft model with only negligent side effects. These results indicate that TSMm could have significant advantages for the treatment of drug-resistant breast cancer and deserves further investigations.
